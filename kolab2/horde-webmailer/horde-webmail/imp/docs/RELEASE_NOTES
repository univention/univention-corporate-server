The Horde Team is pleased to announce the final release of the Internet
Messaging Program (IMP) version H3 (4.3.6).

IMP, the Internet Messaging Program, is one of the most popular webmail
applications available.  It allows universal, web-based access to IMAP and
POP3 mail servers and provides a full range of features normally found only in
desktop email clients.

The major changes compared to IMP version H3 (4.3.5) are:
    * Save References/In-Reply-To headers when saving a draft.
    * Fixed viewing certain S/MIME messages from Outlook (Express).
    * Added Croatian translation.
    * Other minor bugfixes and improvements.
