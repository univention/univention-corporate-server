DIMP is the Dynamic IMP (Internet Messaging Program) application, a PHP-based
webmail system and a component of the Horde project.  DIMP, once installed,
accesses mail over IMAP thus requiring little to no special preparations on the
server on which mail is stored.

This software is OSI Certified Open Source Software.  OSI Certified is a
certification mark of the `Open Source Initiative`_.
