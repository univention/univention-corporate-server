This document contains instructions for installing the DIMP web-based mail
client on your system.

For information on the capabilities and features of DIMP, see the file README_
in the top-level directory of the DIMP distribution.


Obtaining DIMP
==============

Bleeding-edge development versions of DIMP are available via CVS; see the
file `docs/HACKING`_ in the Horde distribution, or the website
http://www.horde.org/source/, for information on accessing the Horde CVS
repository.


Prerequisites
=============

To function properly, DIMP **requires** the following:

1. A working IMP installation.

   DIMP runs on top of IMP.  Therefore, you will need to set-up IMP before you
   can install DIMP.  Please see the `imp/docs/INSTALL`_ file in IMP for
   directions on how to install IMP properly.

   .. IMPORTANT:: DIMP requires the Horde Framework version 3.2+ and IMP
                  version 4.2+ to run. Although not necessary, it is
                  **STRONGLY RECOMMENDED** that you always upgrade IMP
                  to the latest version when upgrading DIMP since any bug
                  fixes to the core libraries occur there.

   The good news is that most configuration needed to run DIMP is accomplished
   inside of IMP.  In other words, if IMP is working correctly, for the most
   part DIMP should be also.  DIMP's configuration is limited to user display
   issues that are different from IMP's base display.


The following items are not required, but are strongly **RECOMMENDED**:

1. PHP version 5.2.5+.

   If using the PHP built-in JSON encoder/decoder (highly recommended as it is
   hundreds of times faster than the fallback PHP code-based version), you
   should be using the latest version of PHP. The PECL json module is badly
   out-of-date (as of version 1.2.1) and does not contain many bug fixes
   for handling message data that contains invalid characters. Using older
   versions of the JSON encoder may result in the JSON output to the browser
   being prematurely terminated, resulting in incomplete or blank screens.

   If you still see this problem after upgrading PHP, your server may have
   incorrect locale information.  See `Bug #5955`_ for further information.

2. A web server with PATH_INFO support.

   DIMP requires a web server that correctly sets the PATH_INFO environment
   variable for all PHP scripts. Every modern web server supports this, but
   you might have to enable this feature in the web server configuration.
   e.g. Apache servers require::

      AcceptPathInfo On

  If the webserver does not provide PATH_INFO information, DIMP attempts to
  create the information using other server variables, but this process is
  slower and less reliable.

Installing DIMP
===============

DIMP is written in PHP, and must be installed in a web-accessible directory.
The precise location of this directory will differ from system to system.
Conventionally, DIMP is installed directly underneath Horde in the web server's
document tree.

Since DIMP is written in PHP, there is no compilation necessary; simply expand
the distribution where you want it to reside and rename the root directory of
the distribution to whatever you wish to appear in the URL.  For example, with
the Apache web server's default document root of ``/usr/local/apache/htdocs``,
you would type::

   cd /usr/local/apache/htdocs/horde
   tar zxvf /path/to/dimp-x.y.z.tar.gz
   mv dimp-x.y.z dimp

and would then find DIMP at the URL::

   http://your-server/horde/dimp/


Configuring DIMP
================

1. Configuring Horde for DIMP

   a. Register the application

      In ``horde/config/registry.php``, find the ``applications['dimp']``
      stanza.  The default settings here should be okay, but you can change
      them if desired.  If you have changed the location of DIMP relative to
      Horde, either in the URL, in the filesystem or both, you must update the
      ``fileroot`` and ``webroot`` settings to their correct values.

   b. Enable IMP authentication [OPTIONAL]

      See IMP's `imp/docs/INSTALL`_ file for details.

2. Configuring DIMP

   To configure DIMP, change to the ``dimp/config/`` directory of the installed
   distribution, and make copies of all of the configuration ``dist`` files
   without the ``dist`` suffix::

      cd config/
      for foo in *.dist; do cp $foo `basename $foo .dist`; done

   Or on Windows::

      copy *.dist *.

   Documentation on the format and purpose of those files can be found in each
   file.

   You must login to Horde as a Horde Administrator to finish the
   configuration of DIMP.  Use the Horde ``Administration`` menu item to get
   to the administration page, and then click on the ``Setup`` icon to get the
   configuration page.  Select ``Dynamic Mail`` from the selection list of
   applications.  Fill in or change any configuration values as needed.  When
   done click on ``Generate Dynamic Mail Configuration`` to generate the
   ``conf.php`` file.  If your web server doesn't have write permissions to
   the DIMP configuration directory or file, it will not be able to write the
   file.  In this case, go back to ``Setup`` and choose one of the other
   methods to create the configuration file ``dimp/config/conf.php``.

   Note for international users: DIMP uses GNU gettext to provide local
   translations of text displayed by applications; the translations are found
   in the ``po/`` directory.  If a translation is not yet available for your
   locale (and you wish to create one), see the ``horde/po/README`` file, or
   if you're having trouble using a provided translation, please see the
   `horde/docs/TRANSLATIONS`_ file for instructions.

3. Securing DIMP

   Before you can secure DIMP, you need a secure Horde installation.  Please
   read the file in `horde/docs/SECURITY`_ for Horde security information
   before proceeding.

   See IMP's `imp/docs/INSTALL`_ file for further details on how to secure
   IMP/DIMP.

4. Tuning DIMP (Performance)

   See `horde/docs/PERFORMANCE`_.


DIMP Troubleshooting
====================

DIMP differs from most traditional Horde applications in that it requires
javascript support and, in fact, javascript performs the bulk of the page
display.  As such, debugging DIMP is more complex than with other Horde
applications.

If you run into problems with DIMP, first follow the troubleshooting steps
for both Horde and IMP - namely checking PHP error logs and Horde debug logs,
to determine if the problem is located there.  Since DIMP uses Horde and IMP
code extensively on the server side, most server-based errors will be logged
in the traditional manner.

Only if traditional debugging is unsuccessful will you need to move to
javascript debugging.  It is highly recommended to use Mozilla Firefox with
the `Firebug`_ extension installed in order to better track javascript errors
- it is what the developers use and makes deciphering error codes and error
line numbers much easier.  Next, it is also recommended to set the ``debug``
parameter in ``dimp/conf/conf.php`` to ``true`` (no quotes) - this will popup
javascript exceptions that may not be able to be caught by Firebug.  Next you
will want to turn off javascript caching, if on, in ``dimp/conf/conf.php``.
Finally, you need to change ``horde/conf/registry.php`` to serve the
javascript files from the ``js/src/`` directory rather than the ``js/``
directory (we compress javascript files to reduce network load, but this
results in all javascript errors occurring on line 1 which is not very useful
to diagnose the problem).

If you do find a javascript error, it would be great if you could fix the
issue and provide a patch :)  Absent that, before reporting to the mailing
list, IRC room, or bug tracker make sure you have a valid javascript error,
the file the error is being caused in, the line number of the error, and a
reliable way to reproduce the error.  Developers/other interested folks will
be much more likely to help you if all this information is provided.
