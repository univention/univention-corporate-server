The Horde Team is pleased to announce the final release of the Kronolith
Calendar Application version H3 (2.3.3).

Kronolith is the Horde calendar application.  It provides web-based calendars
backed by a SQL database or a Kolab server.  Supported features include shared
calendars, remote calendars, meeting management, alarms, recurring events, and
a sophisticated day/week view which handles arbitrary numbers of overlapping
events.

The major changes compared to the Kronolith version H3 (2.3.2) are:
    * Fixed edge cases of weekly recurrences.
    * Fixed editing URLs of remote calendars.
    * Some speed improvements.
    * Improved Oracle compatibility.
    * Added Croatian translation.
    * Other bug fixes and improvements.
