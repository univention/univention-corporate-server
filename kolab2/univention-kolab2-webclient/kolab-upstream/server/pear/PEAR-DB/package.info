# Package summary description
summary='Database Abstraction Layer'

# Long package description
description=' \
DB is a database abstraction layer providing: \
* an OO-style query API \
* portability features that make programs written for one DBMS work with other DBMSs \
* a DSN (data source name) format for specifying database servers \
* prepare/execute (bind) emulation for databases that dont support it natively \
* a result object for each query response \
* portable error codes \
* sequence emulation \
* sequential and non-sequential row fetching as well as bulk fetching \
* formats fetched rows as associative arrays, ordered arrays or objects \
* row limit support \
* transactions support \
* table information interface \
* DocBook and phpDocumentor API documentation \
 \
DB layers itself on top of PHPs existing \
database extensions. \
 \
Drivers for the following extensions pass \
the complete test suite and provide \
interchangeability when all of DBs \
portability options are enabled: \
 \
fbsql, ibase, informix, msql, mssql, \
mysql, mysqli, oci8, odbc, pgsql, \
sqlite and sybase. \
 \
There is also a driver for the dbase \
extension, but it cant be used \
interchangeably because dbase doesnt \
support many standard DBMS features. \
 \
DB is compatible with both PHP 4 and PHP 5. \
