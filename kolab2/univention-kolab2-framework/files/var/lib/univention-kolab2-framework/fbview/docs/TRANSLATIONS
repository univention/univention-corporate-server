GNU gettext, PHP and Horde
--------------------------

Horde uses GNU gettext for internationalization (i18n) and localization
(l10n). The manual at http://www.gnu.org/manual/gettext/index.html is
biased against C and using Emacs. This is more for Horde.

There is a good explanation for PHP and gettext at:
http://www.faqts.com/knowledge-base/view.phtml/aid/2953/fid/422

People seem to like learning from examples better, so I have used
dutch (nl_NL) as an example everywhere.

There is a command line tool written in PHP for creating and managing
translations in the horde/po/ directory. Usage instructions can be found in
horde/po/README.


Translations don't work
-----------------------
If all or some translations don't work on your system, please follow the steps
described below. If you want to ask for help either on the i18n mailing list
(http://horde.org/mail/) or on Horde's bug system, please explain which steps
you tried and which failed.

You might also find some more information in the FAQ at http://horde.org/faq/.

Please note that Dutch (nl_NL) is only used as an example here. If you have
problems with a certain translation use this translation's language code
instead.

Is this locale (nl_NL) installed at all?
$ locale -a
should list all locales installed on your system.

On Debian not all locales may be enabled by default. Edit /etc/locale.gen and
run locale-gen if you changed the list of enabled locales.

Do you have any .mo files? Usually in /usr/share/locale/
e.g. /usr/share/locale/nl/LC_MESSAGES/tar.mo

Does gettext even work?
Get a string to translate,
$ strings /bin/tar | grep Memory
Memory exhausted
$ (LANG=nl_NL; LANGUAGE=nl_NL; LC_MESSAGES=nl_NL; gettext tar "Memory exhausted" )
Geheugen uitgeput

Does the local Horde file work?
Assuming that you have put the translated Horde file in
/data/www/horde/locale/nl_NL/LC_MESSAGES/horde.mo
$ export TEXTDOMAINDIR=/data/www/horde/locale
$ (LANG=nl_NL; LANGUAGE=nl_NL; LC_MESSAGES=nl_NL; gettext horde "Message" )
Bericht

Create a file in the horde directory, langtest.php:
<?php
setlocale(LC_MESSAGES, 'nl_NL');
putenv('LANG=nl_NL');
putenv('LANGUAGE=nl_NL');
// use the tar test.
echo dgettext('tar', 'Memory exhausted');
echo '<br />';

// Specify location of translation tables
bindtextdomain('horde', './locale');

// Choose domain
textdomain('horde');

// Print the already tested message
echo _("Message");
echo '<br />';

// this should print the same.
echo dgettext('horde', 'Message');

?>

Solaris
-------
Since the .mo files are binary, they are platform specific. You
have to rerun make in all po directories.

On Solaris 7, you don't have the Partial Locales (SUNWploc) and Supplementary
Partial Locales (SUNWploc1) packages installed if you get:
$ LANG=nl_NL
couldn't set locale correctly

On Solaris 8, you must install the local packages required for the locales you
desire (for example, you may need to install SUNWweuos for Western European
locales or SUNWmeaos for Middle Eastern locales). The packages are located on
Software Disk 1 of 2 in the directory: sol_8_1001_sparc/s0/Solaris_8/Product

This is what it should say:

Solaris 7:
$ pkginfo | grep ploc
system      SUNWploc       Partial Locales
system      SUNWploc1      Supplementary Partial Locales

Solaris 8:
$ pkginfo | grep euo
system      SUNWceuos      Central Europe OS Support
system      SUNWceuox      Central Europe 64-bit OS Support
system      SUNWeeuos      Eastern Europe OS Support
system      SUNWeeuox      Eastern Europe 64-bit OS Support
system      SUNWneuos      Northern Europe OS Support
system      SUNWneuox      Northern Europe 64-bit OS Support
system      SUNWseuos      Southern Europe OS Support
system      SUNWseuox      Southern Europe 64-bit OS Support
system      SUNWweuos      Western Europe OS Support
system      SUNWweuox      Western Europe 64-bit OS Support

The stuff is installed in /usr/lib/locale
$ ls /usr/lib/locale/nl
LC_COLLATE   LC_CTYPE     LC_MESSAGES  LC_MONETARY  LC_NUMERIC   LC_TIME      nl.so.1

We assume that the Solaris gettext implementation is installed when we compile
the translations. Thus the make process will fail if the installed gettext is
from GNU. If anyone knows how to determine if the installed gettext is from
Solaris or GNU on Solaris systems, please send us a note.

It was also reported that the HTTP server has to be linked to the same
libintl.so file as PHP on Solaris.  Also, it may be required that libintl.so
be loaded before libc is loaded.  If you are having conflicts, you may be
able to reside them by starting apache with one of the following commands:

LD_PRELOAD=libintl.so apachectl start
