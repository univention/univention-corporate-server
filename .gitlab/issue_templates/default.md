## Story

As a \<role\><br/>
I can \<capability\>,<br/>
so that \<receive benefit\>.

## Context/description

A little context to the issue. Where does the task come from, what is needed for implementation. Everything which is important but doesn't fit the user st
ory syntax can be written down here.

A user story should be self-contained and provide value when shipped. It should also contain a "single source of truth".

Additional points:

- If possible, list implementation constraints here (e.g. after a refinement)
- Separation to other user stories
- Desired artifacts (package, documentation, release, etc.)
- Specific requirements regarding documentation if required
- For UI-heavy stories: Mockups, wireframes, storyboards, etc.
