# To ensure proper access rights, 'ident sameuser' access for localhost is
# required in /etc/postgresql/7.4/main/pg_hba.conf.  This is now the default setting for
# the Debian configuration.
#
# If password access for "local" is turned on in /etc/postgresql/7.4/main/pg_hba.conf,
# you must create a file ~postgres/.pgpass containing a line specifying the
# password, as explained in section 1.11 of the PostgreSQL Programmer's Guide
# (package postgresql-doc).
#
# If autovacuum is turned on in /etc/postgresql/7.4/main/postmaster.conf, you need
# to give the -F option to do.maintenance for it to do anything.
