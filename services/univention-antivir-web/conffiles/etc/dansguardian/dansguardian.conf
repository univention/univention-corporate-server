# a) If set to -1, the scanner will send 1 byte per delay period
#    to the client to keep a download connection alive.
#    When the whole file is downloaded and scanned, the client will
#    receive all remaining bytes, if the file was clean.
# b) If set to less than -1 (eg. -1024) the scanner will send,
#    after firsttrickledelay seconds, a proportional amount of data
#    to the client (e.g 1024 bytes per downloaded megabyte); after
#    followingtrickledelay seconds again a proportional amount
#    of data is sent to the client and so on. When the whole file is
#    downloaded and scanned, the client will receive all remaining
#    bytes, if the file was clean.
#    Recommended value: -1024 (1024 bytes per downloaded megabyte)
# c) If set to a positive integer value it enables immediate delivery
#    to the client. The value set means minimum number of bytes of the
#    downloaded file that will be held and delivered after virus scan.
#    If clean, the remaining bytes will be sent to the client.

#    will be sent to the postmaster and possibly the user.

# NOTE:
#    only trickle modes a) and b) allow for limited mime-header
#    rewriting; eg. if a zip file (application/zip) is downloaded
#    and contains a virus it's mime-type is rewritten to text/html
