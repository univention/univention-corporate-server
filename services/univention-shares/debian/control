Description: UCS - core infrastructure for shared directories
 This package contains the core infrastructure to manage
 directories that can be accessed by other computers over
 the network. Most certainly, you will need at least
 univention-samba or univention-nfs so that other computers
 can actually access the shared directories.

 It is part of Univention Corporate Server (UCS), an
 integrated, directory driven solution for managing
 corporate environments. For more information about UCS,
