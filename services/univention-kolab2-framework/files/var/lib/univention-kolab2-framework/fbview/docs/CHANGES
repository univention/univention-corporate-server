----------
v3.0-ALPHA
----------

[jan] Access keys are no longer generated automatically but defined by the
      developers and translators.
[cjh] The new services/prefs.php file is now the only UI page necessary
      for preferences for all applications - all app/prefs.php files
      are now obsolete.
[cjh] Prefs::getPref() has been deprecated and is no longer present.
[cjh] Horde::, Registry::, and the last of the libs that are moving should be
      moved to framework packages now.
[cjh] Editor::, Menu.php, NLS::, and Signup.php have all been moved to
      framework packages.
[mms] Moved the IMAP Tree generation class from IMP to framework so it can
      be used by other applications.
[mdj] Setup now has a more informative format. The CVS version tag is copied
      from the conf.xml file into the conf.php file so that it be used to warn
      which applications need their conf updated.
[cjh] Use javascript to autodetect whether or not the frameset is present.
[cjh] Horde_History, Horde_Links, and Horde_Search have been moved to
      framework packages.
[cjh] Allow apps including horde/lib/base.php to specify that a different
      registry application should actually be pushed onto the Registry
      application stack. This lets the fiction of problem.php being its
      own application play nicely with the new permissions checking.
[cjh] The new application permissions checking has been modified to
      allow access to all authenticated users by default, and to deny
      guest access by default. All variations on that must be set
      explicitly.
[cjh] Remove the Guest Services link; it's been obsoleted by
      $conf['menu']['always'].
[cjh] Various $no_auth and $self_contained_auth flags have been standardized
      into an AUTH_HANDLER constant, which if defined signals the application
      that it should not check permissions upon calling $registry->pushApp(),
      as the calling script will handle that itself, or is a system-level cron
      job/script/etc.
[cjh] Add an option to $registry->pushApp() to specify whether or not to check
      application permissions.
[cjh] The 'allow_guests' setting, and $registry->allowGuests(), have been
      removed in favor of Horde_Perms application permissions.

[jan] Add Auth_login class.

[jan] Move Horde_CLI, Horde_Cache, Horde_Cipher, Horde_Compress,
      Horde_Token and Horde_Util packages to the framework module.
[cjh] Reorganize a number of files from the top level and from util/ into a
      new services/ directory and a number of services/* subdirectories.
      This should give us a better base for expanding the services provided
      by the core Horde module in the future.
[max] Add support for <b> and <i> tags to the Help xml parser.
[cjh] Add the Horde_History API, for storing timestamped events for

      (Etienne Goyer <etienne.goyer@linuxquebec.com>).

[jan] UTF-8 support is enabled by default now.

      rpc.php and the RPC:: API.

[cjh] Groups can now have an email address associated with them.
[cjh] Make Horde-level Blocks configurable through the registry, allowing easier
      adding of new blocks (Joe Wilson <joe.wilson@mindcandy.org>).
[cjh] CategoryTree is now deprecated in favor of Horde_Tree.
[cjh] Move the admin permissions and groups pages to use Horde_Tree.
[max] Add _comparePasswords() function to Auth_sql to correctly compare
      all crypted passwords similar to the Passwd module.
[max] Add crypt-des (which is the same as crypt), crypt-md5, and crypt-blowfish
      encryption types, to match Passwd module.
[max] Add optional show_encryption param to Auth_sql, to match Passwd module.
[mms] Added IP Address check to Auth::authenticate() to increase security.

      menu as a Mozilla sidebar.
[mms] Add IMAP_Cache:: class to handle cached IMAP server data.
[cjh] Make getCategoriesByAttributes() much more sophisticated - it can
      now handle a pretty much arbitrary logic tree - and use it to optimize
      Horde_Share::listShares().
[cjh] Add getCategoriesByAttributes(), and use it in
      Group::getGroupMemberships().
[cjh] Add code that lets a CategoryObject subclass define a mapping from its
      internal data to the new horde_category_attributes table.

[cjh] Add a new API call, Auth::isAuthenticated($realm = null), for
      determining whether or not a user is logged in to the current
      realm (by default null). Auth::getAuth() is still used to get
      the current user, but now you don't need to know the auth realm
      to get the current user - just to check authentication.

[max] Added authentication handler to the Registry.
[jon] The 'session' preferences driver now honors preference scope.
[max] Made sitename title configurable.
[jon] Reworked the Menu::customItem() to accept PHP data structures instead

      Horde::getTempDir() to take care of the housekeeping of temp files.
[max] Added contacts/add service to registry.
[cjh] Registry::call() is now Registry::link(). There is a new
      Registry::call() which actually returns the result of a function call
      made to another application.
[cjh] Fix DB query result checking in sql drivers.
[cjh] Fix help so that generic help links (on menu bars) show the topic list
      correctly.

      support for preference scope (via isShared() and setShared()).
[jon] Added capaiblity tests to those drivers that require non-standard PHP
      extensions (handled by Horde::functionCheck()).
[jon] Added an Auth_LDAP Horde authentication driver.
[cjh] Add little snippet-templates for dynamically building preference GUIs.
[cjh] Rename the Auth interface's auth() method to authenticate() to avoid
      overlapping the name of the constructor for the Auth parent class.
[cjh] The configuration array is now simply $conf. Any settings that must be
      accessible unchanged (not overridden) should be put into $conf['horde'].
      Everything else is fair game for applications to override.
[cjh] Add a wml/wap login form.
[max] Add an Auth_FTP Horde authentication driver.
[cjh] Add an Auth_MCAL Horde authentication driver.
[cjh] The Horde login form now actually does something. Logging in to it
      gets you a token in your session saying that you've authenticated and
      who you are. Apps can then use this information to allow or deny
      access, and to identify users.
[cjh] The format of the config/registry.php file has changed drastically to
      be more readable and less indirect. There is also a new app parameter,
      'allow_guests', which defines whether or not a user is allowed to
      access the application without logging in to Horde.
[cjh] The Auth:: classes now expect to receive a userid and an array of
      credentials. Right now all backends assume that those credentials
      contain a password, but the way is clear to have other kinds of auth
      (IP, time-based, whatever).
[jon] Added a new parameter to the LDAP preferences driver: 'always_bind'.
[cjh] Added a Menu:: class that all modules can use to generate menu items.
[jon] Cleaned up the LDAP preferences driver a bit.
[jon] Added session-level preferences caching to the preferences system.
[cjh] Have Horde::link() make sure that the status text is safe for
      javascript (htmlentities, addslashes).
[cjh] Fix ObjectStore to work when register_globals = On.
[jon] Added a Session-based preferences driver.


------
v1.3.3
------

[cjh] Further revamp the MIME interface. Be consistent in capitalization
      (acronyms are capitalized), break out MIME_Structure and MIME_Message
      into seperate files, and put all methods into classes.
[cjh] Add Horde::getFormData() to fetch a variable from either
      $HTTP_POST_VARS or $HTTP_GET_VARS (and to clean magic quotes, if
      necessary).
[cjh] Remove the Log:: class. This is part of PEAR now.
[cjh] Add a SessionCache:: class. This is intended for storing objects in
      the session intended for near-term use, and will currently start
      throwing out objects when more than 20 are put in. This will hopefully
      keep any one session from growing too large.
[cjh] Use the new PEAR class Mail_rfc822:: to parse address lists, so that
      we get rfc 822 group support (my-buddies: jon@horde,org,
      max@horde.org;), which imap_rfc822_parse_adrlist() doesn't have.
[max] Make Horde XHTML 1.0 compliant.
[cjh] Add a few fields to the problem report and try to make it more friendly.
[cjh] Flesh out the Mime:: class.
[cjh] Move trimEmailAddress() into the new Mime:: class.
[cjh] Move set_env_in_string() to Text::expandEnvironment().
[cjh] Rename horde_cleanup() to _fileCleanup().
[cjh] The zlib module now supplies a gzencode() function that obsoletes
      HTTP_Cache::gzEncode().
[cjh] Modify Horde::url() so that it defaults $conf['use_ssl'] to 2
      (auto-detect current mode).
[cjh] Modernize some of the Horde frontend (still lots to do here); get rid
      of package.HTMLDocument.php once and for all.
[avsm] Breakdown all special characters in URLs to entities, to avoid
      ambiguity in how various browsers parse them.
[cjh] Add Horde::raiseMessage() for creating Horde messages to be displayed
      to the user.
[cjh] Some general UI tweaks - font size, etc.
[cjh] Remove rfcdate() in favor of the new 'r' parameter to date.
[cjh] Added application 'webroot' and 'fileroot' properties to the registry
      config file. These allow more flexibility in placing apps, and let the
      registry work from more places.
[cjh] Moved package.Registry.php to Registry.php.
[cjh] Commented config/horde.php.dist heavily.
[cjh] Add a Secret:: class to Horde.php that provides a transparent
      interface to either the mcrypt extension (preferred) or the PEAR
      Crypt_HCEMD5:: class.
[jon] Accept a user-defined function for performing username lookups in the
      preferences code.  The preferences constructor looks for the function
      in $params['user_hook'].
[cjh] Check HTTP_ENV_VARS for the user-agent as well as HTTP_SERVER_VARS.
[cjh] Remove mailfrom() in favor of the PEAR Mail:: interface. Adjust the
      conf files and problem.php accordingly.
[cjh] Add a set of invoke() methods to the Registry:: class for directly
      invoking services (ie, actually popping up a window) instead of
      printing links to invoke them.
[cjh] Clean up package.Mime.php a bit; don't set a charset on MIME parts
      that aren't text.
[cjh] Added a file driver for the Connection:: class.
[cjh] Added a WAP index to provide quick links to all Horde wireless pages.
[cjh] Add basic WAP browser detection to Browser::. Currently this is of the
      "it detects the phone I have and the simulator I use" variety; it is
      _very_ far from complete.
[cjh] Added Max Kalika's Connection:: class for connection tracking.
[cjh] HTTP_Cache:: now compresses content without the use of a temp file.
[cjh] Fleshed out the Auth:: class with the ability to cache authorization
      in the session.
[jon] Removed the scripted wordwrap in favor of the native function.  Moved
      the wrap_message() function to Text::wrap().
[jon] Standardize on the rfcdate() function in lib/Horde.php.
[cjh] The prefs drivers now expect $params['hostspec'], for consistency with
      PEAR.
[cjh] The PEAR sql prefs driver now works.
[cjh] Move horde configuration values that should not be overridded by
      modules into $horde['horde'][] to allow modules to do
      overriding/inheritance of other options.
[cjh] Add the HTTP_Cache:: class to Horde.php for ETag generation, gzip
      compression of http content, etc.
[cjh] Replace $horde['localhost'] with $HTTP_SERVER_VARS['SERVER_NAME'].
[cjh] Reject outright envelope From addresses with spaces in them.
[cjh] Quote the from address passed to sendmail to prevent shell exploits.
[cjh] Update Browser.php to use HTTP_SERVER_VARS, consolidate the javascript
      version information, and add ssl_download_hack for browsers that need
      downloads to be cacheable.
[jon] Add Text::filter to lib/Horde.php.
[cjh] Check the return value of pclose() correctly in mailfrom().
[jon] Security fix for $from value in mailfrom(). <cw@coc-ag.net>
[jon] Silence session_start warnings.
[jon] Added new |extra| substitution to config/registry.php for extra,
      non-standard parameter passing.
[jon] Remove buildURL().  It's been replaced by Horde::url().
[jon] Restructured the SQL preferences schema.
[cjh] Added $horde['session_name'] to control the session name globally.
[cjh] Session:: doesn't really buy us anything, so we've moved the utility
      methods that do into Horde::, and are just using php4 session calls
      elsewhere.
[cjh] Added the beginnings of User and Auth interfaces, with a bare-bones
      working Auth_sql implementation.
[jon] Rewrote the Session class for instantiation with hooks for
      user-defined session handlers.
[cjh] The bare-bones implementation of the Perms scheme, with a sql driver,
      works. If you pass it a full path it will traverse up it, returning
      the first permission it finds.
[jon] Moved the language handling functions in Horde.php into their own
      classed named Lang.
[cjh] More consistent/css-based look for the help system.
[cjh] Starting to remove all uses of call-time pass-by-reference.
[cjh] Added css.php for automagical generation of stylesheets for apps.
[jon] Promoted the WebClient class from lib/Horde.php to its own component
      named Browser.php.
[cjh] Use wordwrap in a slightly different way, which seems to produce much
      prettier quoting of messages.
[jon] Added Prefs/mysql.php driver from Max Kalika <max@the-triumvirate.net>.
[jon] New XML-based help subsystem.
[cjh] Renamed package.horde.php to Horde.php.
[cjh] Add img() and pimg() functions to the Horde:: class so that modules
      using only stylesheets don't need the HTMLDocument package.
[cjh] Omit the session name/id from the URL if we can verify that cookies
      are being accepted.
[jon] New wrap_message function that uses the native wordwrap function if it
      exists.
[jon] Updating header comment copyright information.
[jon] Report module versions in test.php output.
[cjh] mime_encapsulate() now uses an array instead of an object.
[jon] Removed the $_html['compose*'] sizing parameters from config/html.php.
[cjh] Leave Bcc: out of the headers that are passed to sendmail.
[jon] Rewrite a good portion of the scripts/set_perms.sh script so
      that it enforces an extremely high level of security.
[cjh] The valid_lang() function now requires $nls['languages'][<language>]
      to be set for a language to be considered valid (instead of just the
      locale directory existing).
[cjh] Added a &singleton() method to make it easier to only create one log
      instance, no matter when you need it.
[cjh] Now mailfrom() works for recipient addresses with single quotes or
      other characters that need to be escaped in them.
[cjh] Log class now has an mcal instance, a composite (for grouping multiple
      log backends), and observers register the level of events they want to
      hear about, and only get notified of events as important or more
      important than that level.
[cjh] Added a Log:: framework and syslog implementation, including a
      Log_observer class intended to sit on top of Lob objects and take
      action in exceptional circumstances.
[cjh] Make sure to always send a charset with emails.
[cjh] Improved the mime_decode() and mime_encode() functions.
[cjh] Updated test.php to recognize php4 stable releases.
[jon] Removed all of the locale/*.lang dependencies.
[jon] Assume the browser is frames-capable by default.
[cjh] Add horde_cleanup($filename), which takes care of deleting files that
      should be unlinked regardless of whether or not the request is
      canceled by the user before we finish executing.
[cjh] Remove phplib dependancy in favor of php4 sessions/PEAR.
[cjh] Replace use with require_once.
[cjh] Fixed up select_lang() to work (identical to 1.2 now)
[cjh] Horde is now under the LGPL.
[cjh] Fix mailfrom() so it doesn't send extra headers when using mail()
[cjh] Adding a 'margins' attribute to HTMLDocument to enable turning off
      document margins.

------

[cjh] Revamped the MimeMessage class to be much smaller and simpler.

      cleanly and correctly implement the MIME standard.
[cjh] select_lang() now checks for en when the browser requests en_GB, etc.
[cjh] Replaced all calls to ereg* functions with preg* functions, for speed.
      Because of this we now require php 3.0.12 or later.
