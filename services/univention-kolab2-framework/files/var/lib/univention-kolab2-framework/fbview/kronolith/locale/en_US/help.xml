    <title>Recurring Events</title>
    <heading>Recurring Events</heading>
    <para>
    Events can be made to repeat in various ways. Many events repeat in certain frequently used ways. For example, the <i>Monthly</i> recurrence types make the selected item repeat each month and the <i>Weekly</i> recurrence type makes the selected item repeat each per week. These can be made to represent events that repeat in complex ways: for example, an item that occurs on the last Friday of each month, or an item that occurs on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday every week. 
    </para>
    <para>
    You can also restrict how long an event repeats by selecting the <i>end date</i> for the event's recurrence.
    </para>
    <para>
    Normally, a modification to a repeating event applies to all occurrences of that event. A single occurrence of a repeating event can be modified by editing the occurrence, removing its recurrence information, and then choosing the <i>Save as New</i> option from the Repeat menu. The selected occurrence can now be modified independently of the other occurences.
