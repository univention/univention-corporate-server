#GENERAL NOTES:
#  This file is a normal Perl code, interpreted by Perl itself.
#  - make sure this file (or directory where it resides) is NOT WRITABLE
#    by mere mortals, otherwise it represents a severe security risk!
#  - for values which are interpreted as booleans, it is recommended
#    to use 1 for true, and 0 or undef or '' for false.
#    THIS IS DIFFERENT FROM OLDER AMAVIS VERSIONS where "no" also meant false,
#    now it means true, like any nonempty string does!
#  - Perl syntax applies. Most notably: strings in "" may include variables
#    (which start with $ or @); to include characters @ and $ in double
#    quoted strings, precede them by a backslash; in single-quoted strings
#    the $ and @ lose their special meaning, so it is usually easier to use
#    single quoted strings. Still, in both cases backslash needs to be doubled.
#  - variables with names starting with a '@' are lists, the values assigned
#    to them should be lists as well, e.g. ('one@foo', $mydomain, "three");
#    note the comma-separation and parenthesis. If strings in the list
#    do not contain spaces nor variables, a Perl operator qw() may be used
#    as a shorthand to split its argument on whitespace and produce a list
#    of strings, e.g. qw( one@foo example.com three );  Note that the argument
#    to qw is quoted implicitly and no variable interpretation is done within
#    (no '$' variable evaluations). The #-initiated comments can not be used
#    within the string. In other words, $ and # lose their special meaning
#    within a qw argument, just like within '...' strings.
#  - all e-mail addresses in this file and as used internally by the daemon
#    are in their raw (rfc2821-unquoted and nonbracketed) form, i.e. 
#    Bob "Funny" Dude@example.com, not: "Bob \"Funny\" Dude"@example.com
#    and not <"Bob \"Funny\" Dude"@example.com>; also: '' and not '<>'.

# Section I - Essential daemon and MTA settings
#

# $MYHOME serves as a quick default for some other configuration settings.
# More refined control is available with each individual setting further down.
# $MYHOME is not used directly by the program. No trailing slash!
$MYHOME = '/var/lib/amavis';   # (default is '/var/amavis')

# $mydomain serves as a quick default for some other configuration settings.
# More refined control is available with each individual setting further down.
# $mydomain is never used directly by the program.
$mydomain = '@%@domainname@%@';      # (no useful default)

$myhostname = '@%@hostname@%@.@%@domainname@%@';  # fqdn of this host

# Set the user and group to which the daemon will change if started as root
# (otherwise just keeps the UID unchanged, and these settings have no effect):
$daemon_user  = 'amavis';	# (no default (undef))
$daemon_group = 'amavis';	# (no default (undef))

# Runtime working directory (cwd), and a place where
# temporary directories for unpacking mail are created.
# if you change this, you might want to modify the cleanup()
# function in /etc/init.d/amavisd-new
# (no trailing slash, may be a scratch file system)
$TEMPBASE = $MYHOME;           # (must be set if other config vars use is)
#$TEMPBASE = "$MYHOME/tmp";     # prefer to keep home dir /var/amavis clean?

# $helpers_home sets environment variable HOME, and is passed as option
# 'home_dir_for_helpers' to Mail::SpamAssassin::new. It should be a directory
# on a normal persistent file system, not a scratch or temporary file system
#$helpers_home = $MYHOME;      # (defaults to $MYHOME)

# Run the daemon in the specified chroot jail if nonempty:
#$daemon_chroot_dir = $MYHOME;  # (default is undef, meaning: do not chroot)

$pid_file  = "/var/run/amavis/amavisd.pid";  # (default: "$MYHOME/amavisd.pid")
$lock_file = "/var/run/amavis/amavisd.lock"; # (default: "$MYHOME/amavisd.lock")

# set environment variables if you want (no defaults):
$ENV{TMPDIR} = $TEMPBASE;       # wise, but usually not necessary
#...

#$protocol = "AM.PDP"; # Use AM.PDP protocol.

# MTA SETTINGS, UNCOMMENT AS APPROPRIATE,
# both $forward_method and $notify_method default to 'smtp:127.0.0.1:10025'

# POSTFIX, or SENDMAIL in dual-MTA setup, or EXIM V4
# (set host and port number as required; host can be specified
# as IP address or DNS name (A or CNAME, but MX is ignored)
#$forward_method = 'smtp:127.0.0.1:10025';  # where to forward checked mail
#$notify_method = $forward_method;          # where to submit notifications

# NOTE: The defaults (above) are good for Postfix or dual-sendmail. You MUST
#       uncomment the appropriate settings below if using other setups!

# SENDMAIL MILTER, using amavis-milter.c helper program:
# SEE amavisd-new-milter package docs FOR DEBIAN INSTRUCTIONS

#$forward_method = undef;  # no explicit forwarding, sendmail does it by itself

# milter; option -odd is needed to avoid deadlocks
#$notify_method = 'pipe:flags=q argv=/usr/sbin/sendmail -Ac -i -odd -f ${sender} -- ${recipient}';

# just a thought: can we use use -Am instead of -odd ?

# SENDMAIL (old non-milter setup, as relay):
#$forward_method = 'pipe:flags=q argv=/usr/sbin/sendmail -C/etc/sendmail.orig.cf -i -f ${sender} -- ${recipient}';
#$notify_method = $forward_method;

# SENDMAIL (old non-milter setup, amavis.c calls local delivery agent):
#$forward_method = undef;  # no explicit forwarding, amavis.c will call LDA
#$notify_method = 'pipe:flags=q argv=/usr/sbin/sendmail -Ac -i -f ${sender} -- ${recipient}';

# EXIM v3 (not recommended with v4 or later, which can use SMTP setup instead):
#$forward_method = 'pipe:flags=q argv=/usr/sbin/exim -oMr scanned-ok -i -f ${sender} -- ${recipient}';
#$notify_method = $forward_method;

# prefer to collect mail for forwarding as BSMTP files?
#$forward_method = "bsmtp:$MYHOME/out-%i-%n.bsmtp";
#$notify_method = $forward_method;


# Net::Server pre-forking settings
# You may want $max_servers to match the width of your MTA pipe
# feeding amavisd, e.g. with Postfix the 'Max procs' field in the
# master.cf file, like the '2' in the:  smtp-amavis unix - - n - 2 smtp
#

$child_timeout=5*60;  # abort child if it does not complete each task in n sec
                      # (default: 8*60 seconds)

# Check also the settings of @av_scanners at the end if you want to use
# virus scanners. If not, you may want to delete the whole long assignment
# to the variable @av_scanners, which will also remove the virus checking
# code (e.g. if you only want to do spam scanning).

# Here is a QUICK WAY to completely DISABLE some sections of code
# that WE DO NOT WANT (it won't even be compiled-in).
# For more refined controls leave the following two lines commented out,
# and see further down what these two lookup lists really mean.
#
# @bypass_virus_checks_acl = qw( . );  # uncomment to DISABLE anti-virus code
# @bypass_spam_checks_acl  = qw( . );  # uncomment to DISABLE anti-spam code

# Lookup list of local domains (see README.lookups for syntax details)
#
# NOTE:
#   For backwards compatibility the variable names @local_domains (old) and
#   @local_domains_acl (new) are synonyms. For consistency with other lookups
#   the name @local_domains_acl is now preferred. It also makes it more
#   obviously distinct from the new %local_domains hash lookup table.
#
# local_domains* lookup tables are used in deciding whether a recipient
# is local or not, or in other words, if the message is outgoing or not.
# This affects inserting spam-related headers for local recipients,
# limiting recipient virus notifications (if enabled) to local recipients,
# in deciding if address extension may be appended, and in SQL lookups
# for non-fqdn addresses. Set it up correctly if you need features
# that rely on this setting (or just leave empty otherwise).
#
# With Postfix (2.0) a quick reminder on what local domains normally are:
# a union of domains specified in: $mydestination, $virtual_alias_domains,
# $virtual_mailbox_domains, and $relay_domains.
#

# Section II - MTA specific (defaults should be ok)
#

# if $relayhost_is_client is true, the IP address in $notify_method and
# $forward_method is dynamically overridden with SMTP client peer address
# (if available), which makes it possible for several hosts to share one

# calculated  as being one above the incoming SMTP/LMTP session port number.
#
# These are logged at level 3, so enable logging until you know you got it
# right.

# SMTP SERVER (INPUT) access control
# - do not allow free access to the amavisd SMTP port !!!
#
# when MTA is at the same host, use the following (one or the other or both):
$inet_socket_bind = '127.0.0.1';  # limit socket bind to loopback interface
                                  # (default is '127.0.0.1')

                                  # (default is qw( 127.0.0.1 ) )

# when MTA (one or more) is on a different host, use the following:
# @inet_acl = qw(127/8 10.1.0.1 10.1.0.2);  # adjust the list as appropriate
# $inet_socket_bind = undef;      # bind to all IP interfaces if undef
#
# Example1:
# @inet_acl = qw( 127/8 10/8 172.16/12 192.168/16 );
# permit only SMTP access from loopback and rfc1918 private address space
#
# Example2:
# @inet_acl = qw( !192.168.1.12 172.16.3.3 !172.16.3/255.255.255.0
#		  127.0.0.1 10/8 172.16/12 192.168/16 );
# matches loopback and rfc1918 private address space except host 192.168.1.12
# and net 172.16.3/24 (but host 172.16.3.3 within 172.16.3/24 still matches)
#
# Example3:
# @inet_acl = qw( 127/8
#		  !172.16.3.0   !172.16.3.127 172.16.3.0/25
#		  !172.16.3.128 !172.16.3.255 172.16.3.128/25 );

#
# Section IV - Notifications/DSN, BOUNCE/REJECT/DROP/PASS destiny, quarantine
#

# Select notifications text encoding when Unicode-aware Perl is converting
# text from internal character representation to external encoding (charset
# in MIME terminology). Used as argument to Perl Encode::encode subroutine.
#
#   to be used in RFC 2047-encoded header field bodies, e.g. in Subject:
#$hdr_encoding = 'iso-8859-1';  # (default: 'iso-8859-1')
#
#   to be used in notification body text: its encoding and Content-type.charset
#$bdy_encoding = 'iso-8859-1';  # (default: 'iso-8859-1')

# Default template texts for notifications may be overruled by directly
# assigning new text to template variables, or by reading template text
# from files. A second argument may be specified in a call to read_text(),
# specifying character encoding layer to be used when reading from the
# external file, e.g. 'utf8', 'iso-8859-1', or often just $bdy_encoding.
# Text will be converted to internal character representation by Perl 5.8.0
# or later; second argument is ignored otherwise. See PerlIO::encoding,
# Encode::PerlIO and perluniintro man pages.

# Here is an overall picture (sequence of events) of how pieces fit together
# (only virus controls are shown, spam controls work the same way):
#
#   bypass_virus_checks? ==> PASS
#   no viruses?   ==> PASS
#   log virus     if $log_templ is nonempty
#   quarantine    if $virus_quarantine_to is nonempty
#   notify admin  if $virus_admin (lookup) nonempty
#   notify recips if $warnvirusrecip and (recipient is local or $warn_offsite)
#   add address extensions if adding extensions is enabled and virus will pass
#   send (non-)delivery notifications
#      to sender if DSN needed (BOUNCE or ($warn_virus_sender and D_PASS))
#   virus_lovers or final_destiny==D_PASS  ==> PASS
#   DISCARD (2xx) or REJECT (5xx) (depending on final_*_destiny)
#
# Equivalent flow diagram applies for spam checks.
# If a virus is detected, spam checking is skipped entirely.

# The following symbolic constants can be used in *destiny settings:
#
# D_PASS     mail will pass to recipients, regardless of bad contents;
#
# D_DISCARD  mail will not be delivered to its recipients, sender will NOT be
#            notified. Effectively we lose mail (but will be quarantined
#            unless disabled). Losing mail is not decent for a mailer,
#            but might be desired.
#
# D_BOUNCE   mail will not be delivered to its recipients, a non-delivery
#            notification (bounce) will be sent to the sender by amavisd-new;
#            Exception: bounce (DSN) will not be sent if a virus name matches
#            $viruses_that_fake_sender_re, or to messages from mailing lists
#            (Precedence: bulk|list|junk);
#
# D_REJECT   mail will not be delivered to its recipients, sender should
#            preferably get a reject, e.g. SMTP permanent reject response
#            (e.g. with milter), or non-delivery notification from MTA
#            (e.g. Postfix). If this is not possible (e.g. different recipients
#            have different tolerances to bad mail contents and not using LMTP)
#            amavisd-new sends a bounce by itself (same as D_BOUNCE).
#
# Notes:
#   D_REJECT and D_BOUNCE are similar, the difference is in who is responsible
#            for informing the sender about non-delivery, and how informative
#            the notification can be (amavisd-new knows more than MTA);
#   With D_REJECT, MTA may reject original SMTP, or send DSN (delivery status
#            notification, colloquially called 'bounce') - depending on MTA;
#            Best suited for sendmail milter, especially for spam.
#   With D_BOUNCE, amavisd-new (not MTA) sends DSN (can better explain the
#            reason for mail non-delivery, but unable to reject the original
#            SMTP session). Best suited to reporting viruses, and for Postfix
#            and other dual-MTA setups, which can't reject original client SMTP
#            session, as the mail has already been enqueued.

$final_virus_destiny      = D_DISCARD; # (defaults to D_BOUNCE)
$final_banned_destiny     = D_BOUNCE;  # (defaults to D_BOUNCE)
$final_spam_destiny       = D_PASS;  # (defaults to D_REJECT)
$final_bad_header_destiny = D_PASS;  # (defaults to D_PASS), D_BOUNCE suggested

# Alternatives to consider for spam:
# - use D_PASS if clients will do filtering based on inserted mail headers;
# - use D_DISCARD, if kill_level is set safely high;
# - use D_BOUNCE instead of D_REJECT if not using milter;
#
# D_BOUNCE is preferred for viruses, but consider:
# - use D_DISCARD to avoid bothering the rest of the network, it is hopeless
#   to try to keep up with the viruses that faker the envelope sender anyway,
#   and bouncing only increases the network cost of viruses for everyone
# - use D_PASS (or virus_lovers) and $warnvirussender=1 to deliver viruses;
# - use D_REJECT instead of D_BOUNCE if using milter and under heavy
#   virus storm;
#
# Don't bother to set both D_DISCARD and $warn*sender=1, it will get mapped
# to D_BOUNCE.
#
# The separation of *_destiny values into D_BOUNCE, D_REJECT, D_DISCARD
# and D_PASS made settings $warnvirussender and $warnspamsender only still
# useful with D_PASS.

# The following $warn*sender settings are ONLY used when mail is
# actually passed to recipients ($final_*_destiny=D_PASS, or *_lovers*).
# Bounces or rejects produce non-delivery status notification anyway.

# Notify virus sender?

# Notify spam sender?
#$warnspamsender = 1;	# (defaults to false (undef))

# Notify sender of syntactically invalid header containing non-ASCII characters?
#$warnbadhsender = 1;	# (defaults to false (undef))

# Notify virus (or banned files) RECIPIENT?
#  (not very useful, but some policies demand it)
#$warnvirusrecip = 1;	# (defaults to false (undef))
#$warnbannedrecip = 1;	# (defaults to false (undef))

# Treat envelope sender address as unreliable and don't send sender
# notification / bounces if name(s) of detected virus(es) match the list.

# When using the 'local:' quarantine method (default), the following applies:
#
# A finer control of quarantining is available through variable
# $virus_quarantine_to/$spam_quarantine_to. It may be a simple scalar string,
# or a ref to a hash lookup table, or a regexp lookup table object,
# which makes possible to set up per-recipient quarantine addresses.
#
# The value of scalar $virus_quarantine_to/$spam_quarantine_to (or a
# per-recipient lookup result from the hash table %$virus_quarantine_to)
# is/are interpreted as follows:
#
# VARIANT 1:
#   empty or undef disables quarantine;
#
# VARIANT 2:
#   a string NOT containing an '@';
# amavisd will behave as a local delivery agent (LDA) and will quarantine
# viruses to local files according to hash %local_delivery_aliases (pseudo
# aliases map) - see subroutine mail_to_local_mailbox() for details.
# Some of the predefined aliases are 'virus-quarantine' and 'spam-quarantine'.
# Setting $virus_quarantine_to ($spam_quarantine_to) to this string will:
#
# * if $QUARANTINEDIR is a directory, each quarantined virus will go
#   to a separate file in the $QUARANTINEDIR directory (traditional
#   amavis style, similar to maildir mailbox format);
#
# * otherwise $QUARANTINEDIR is treated as a file name of a Unix-style
#   mailbox. All quarantined messages will be appended to this file.
#   Amavisd child process must obtain an exclusive lock on the file during
#   delivery, so this may be less efficient than using individual files
#   or forwarding to MTA, and it may not work across NFS or other non-local
#   file systems (but may be handy for pickup of quarantined files via IMAP
#   for example);
#
# VARIANT 3:
#   any email address (must contain '@').
# The e-mail messages to be quarantined will be handed to MTA
# for delivery to the specified address. If a recipient address local to MTA
# is desired, you may leave the domain part empty, e.g. 'infected@', but the
# '@' character must nevertheless be included to distinguish it from variant 2.
#
# This method enables more refined delivery control made available by MTA
# (e.g. its aliases file, other local delivery agents, dealing with
# privileges and file locking when delivering to user's mailbox, nonlocal
# delivery and forwarding, fan-out lists). Make sure the mail-to-be-quarantined
# will not be handed back to amavisd for checking, as this will cause a loop
# (hopefully broken at some stage)! If this can be assured, notifications
# will benefit too from not being unnecessarily virus-scanned.
#
# By default this is safe to do with Postfix and Exim v4 and dual-sendmail
# setup, but probably not safe with sendmail milter interface without
# precaution.

# Section V - Per-recipient and per-sender handling, whitelisting, etc.
#

# %virus_lovers, @virus_lovers_acl and $virus_lovers_re lookup tables:
#   (these should be considered policy options, they do not disable checks,
#   see bypass*checks for that!)
#
# Exclude certain RECIPIENTS from virus filtering by adding their lower-cased
# envelope e-mail address (or domain only) to the hash %virus_lovers, or to
# the access list @virus_lovers_acl - see README.lookups and examples.
# Make sure the appropriate form (e.g. external/internal) of address
# is used in case of virtual domains, or when mapping external to internal
# addresses, etc. - this is MTA-specific.
#
# Notifications would still be generated however (see the overall
# picture above), and infected mail (if passed) gets additional header:
#   X-AMaViS-Alert: INFECTED, message contains virus: ...
# (header not inserted with milter interface!)
#
# NOTE (milter interface only): in case of multiple recipients,
# it is only possible to drop or accept the message in its entirety - for all
# recipients. If all of them are virus lovers, we'll accept mail, but if
# at least one recipient is not a virus lover, we'll discard the message.


# %bypass_virus_checks, @bypass_virus_checks_acl and $bypass_virus_checks_re
# lookup tables:
#   (this is mainly a time-saving option, unlike virus_lovers* !)
#
# Similar in concept to %virus_lovers, a hash %bypass_virus_checks,
# access list @bypass_virus_checks_acl and regexp list $bypass_virus_checks_re
# are used to skip entirely the decoding, unpacking and virus checking,
# but only if ALL recipients match the lookup.
#
# %bypass_virus_checks/@bypass_virus_checks_acl/$bypass_virus_checks_re
# do NOT GUARANTEE the message will NOT be checked for viruses - this may
# still happen when there is more than one recipient for a message, and
# not all of them match these lookup tables. To guarantee virus delivery,
# a recipient must also match %virus_lovers/@virus_lovers_acl lookups
# (but see milter limitations above),

# NOTE: it would not be clever to base virus checks on SENDER address,
# since there are no guarantees that it is genuine. Many viruses
# and spam messages fake sender address. To achieve selective filtering
# based on the source of the mail (e.g. IP address, MTA port number, ...),
# use mechanisms provided by MTA if available.


# Similar to lookup tables controlling virus checking, there exist
# spam scanning, banned names/types, and headers_checks control counterparts:
#   %spam_lovers, @spam_lovers_acl, $spam_lovers_re
#   %banned_files_lovers, @banned_files_lovers_acl, $banned_files_lovers_re
#   %bad_header_lovers, @bad_header_lovers_acl, $bad_header_lovers_re
# and:
#   %bypass_spam_checks/@bypass_spam_checks_acl/$bypass_spam_checks_re
#   %bypass_banned_checks/@bypass_banned_checks_acl/$bypass_banned_checks_re
#   %bypass_header_checks/@bypass_header_checks_acl/$bypass_header_checks_re
# See README.lookups for details about the syntax.

# The following example disables spam checking altogether,
# since it matches any recipient e-mail address (any address
# is a subdomain of the top-level root DNS domain):
#   @bypass_spam_checks_acl = qw( . );

#   @bypass_header_checks_acl = qw( user@example.com );
#   @bad_header_lovers_acl    = qw( user@example.com );


# See README.lookups for further detail, and examples below.

# $virus_lovers{lc("postmaster\@$mydomain")} = 1;
# $virus_lovers{lc('postmaster@example.com')} = 1;
# $virus_lovers{lc('abuse@example.com')} = 1;
# $virus_lovers{lc('some.user@')} = 1;  # this recipient, regardless of domain
# $virus_lovers{lc('boss@example.com')} = 0; # never, even if domain matches
# $virus_lovers{lc('example.com')} = 1; # this domain, but not its subdomains
# $virus_lovers{lc('.example.com')}= 1; # this domain, including its subdomains
#or:
# @virus_lovers_acl = qw( me@lab.xxx.com !lab.xxx.com .xxx.com yyy.org );
#
# $bypass_virus_checks{lc('some.user2@butnot.example.com')} = 1;

# $spam_lovers{lc('abuse@example.com')} = 1;
# @spam_lovers_acl = qw( !.example.com );
# $spam_lovers_re = new_RE( qr'^user@example\.com$'i );


# don't run spam check for these RECIPIENT domains:
#   @bypass_spam_checks_acl = qw( d1.com .d2.com a.d3.com );
# or the other way around (bypass check for all BUT these):
#   @bypass_spam_checks_acl = qw( !d1.com !.d2.com !a.d3.com . );
# a practical application: don't check outgoing mail for spam:
#   @bypass_spam_checks_acl = ( "!.$mydomain", "." );

# If you decide to pass viruses (or spam) to certain recipients using the

# as an address extension to the local-part of the address. This extension
# can be used by final local delivery agent to place such mail in different
# folders. Leave these two variables undefined or empty strings to prevent
# appending address extensions. Setting has no effect on recipient which will
# not be receiving viruses/spam. Recipients who do not match lookup tables
# local_domains* are not affected.
#
# LDAs usually default to stripping away address extension if no special
# handling is specified, so having this option enabled normally does no harm,
# provided the $recipients_delimiter matches the setting on the final

#
# Delimiter should match equivalent (final) MTA delimiter setting.

# ENVELOPE SENDER WHITELISTING / BLACKLISTING  - GLOBAL (RECIPIENT-INDEPENDENT)
# (affects spam checking only, has no effect on virus and other checks)

# WHITELISTING: use ENVELOPE SENDER lookups to ENSURE DELIVERY from whitelisted
# senders even if the message is recognized as spam. Effectively, for the
# specified senders, message RECIPIENTS temporarily become 'spam_lovers', with
# further processing being the same as otherwise specified for spam lovers.
# It does not turn off inserting spam-related headers, if they are enabled.
#
# BLACKLISTING: messages from specified SENDERS are DECLARED SPAM.
# Effectively, for messages from blacklisted senders, spam level
# is artificially pushed high, and the normal spam processing applies,
# resulting in 'X-Spam-Flag: YES', high 'X-Spam-Level' bar and other usual
# reactions to spam, including possible rejection. If the message nevertheless
# still passes (e.g. for spam loving recipients), it is tagged as BLACKLISTED
# in the 'X-Spam-Status' header field, but the reported spam value and
# set of tests in this report header field (if available from SpamAssassin,
# which may have not been called) is not adjusted.
#
# A sender may be both white- and blacklisted at the same time,
# settings are independent. For example, being both white- and blacklisted,
# message is delivered to recipients, but is tagged as spam.
#
# If ALL recipients of the message either white- or blacklist the sender,
# spam scanning (calling the SpamAssassin) is bypassed, saving on time.
#
# The following variables (lookup tables) are available, with the semantics
# and syntax as specified in README.lookups:
#
# %whitelist_sender, @whitelist_sender_acl, $whitelist_sender_re
# %blacklist_sender, @blacklist_sender_acl, $blacklist_sender_re

# SOME EXAMPLES:
#
#ACL:
# @whitelist_sender_acl = qw( .example.com );
#
# @whitelist_sender_acl = ( ".$mydomain" );  # $mydomain and its subdomains
# NOTE: This is not a reliable way of turning off spam checks for
#       locally-originating mail, as sender address can easily be faked.
#       To reliably avoid spam-scanning outgoing mail,
#       use @bypass_spam_checks_acl .

# ENVELOPE SENDER WHITELISTING / BLACKLISTING - PER-RECIPIENT

# The same semantics as for global white/blacklisting applies, but this
# time each recipient (or its domain, or subdomain, ...) can be given
# an individual lookup table for matching senders. The per-recipient lookups
# override the global lookups, which serve as a fallback default.

# Specify a two-level lookup table: the key for the outer table is recipient,
# and the result should be an inner lookup table (hash or ACL or RE),
# where the key used will be the sender.
#
#$per_recip_blacklist_sender_lookup_tables = {
# 'user1@my.example.com'=>new_RE(qr'^(inkjetplanet|marketopt|MakeMoney)\d*@'i),
# 'user2@my.example.com'=>[qw( spammer@d1.example,org .d2.example,org )],
#};
#$per_recip_whitelist_sender_lookup_tables = {
# 'user@my.example.com' => [qw( friend@example.org .other.example.org )],
# '.my1.example.com'    => [qw( !foe.other.example,org .other.example,org )],
# '.my2.example.com'    => read_hash('/var/amavis/my2-wl.dat'),

#
# Section VI - Resource limits
#

# Sanity limit to the number of allowed recipients per SMTP transaction
# $smtpd_recipient_limit = 1000;  # (default is 1000)


# Resource limits to protect unpackers, decompressors and virus scanners
# against mail bombs (e.g. 42.zip)

# Maximum recursion level for extraction/decoding (0 or undef disables limit)
$MAXLEVELS = 14;		# (default is undef, no limit)

# Maximum number of extracted files (0 or undef disables the limit)
$MAXFILES = 1500;		# (default is undef, no limit)

# For the cumulative total of all decoded mail parts we set max storage size
# to defend against mail bombs. Even though parts may be deleted (replaced
# by decoded text) during decoding, the size they occupied is _not_ returned
# to the quota pool.
#
# Parameters to storage quota formula for unpacking/decoding/decompressing
#   Formula:
#     quota = max($MIN_EXPANSION_QUOTA,
#                 $mail_size*$MIN_EXPANSION_FACTOR,
#                 min($MAX_EXPANSION_QUOTA, $mail_size*$MAX_EXPANSION_FACTOR))
#   In plain words (later condition overrules previous ones):
#     allow MAX_EXPANSION_FACTOR times initial mail size,
#     but not more than MAX_EXPANSION_QUOTA,
#     but not less than MIN_EXPANSION_FACTOR times initial mail size,
#     but never less than MIN_EXPANSION_QUOTA
#
$MIN_EXPANSION_QUOTA =      100*1024;  # bytes  (default undef, not enforced)
$MAX_EXPANSION_QUOTA = 300*1024*1024;  # bytes  (default undef, not enforced)
$MIN_EXPANSION_FACTOR =   5;  # times original mail size  (must be specified)
$MAX_EXPANSION_FACTOR = 500;  # times original mail size  (must be specified)


#
# Section VII - External programs, virus scanners
#

# Specify a path string, which is a colon-separated string of directories
# (no trailing slashes!) to be assigned to the environment variable PATH
# and to serve for locating external programs below.

# NOTE: if $daemon_chroot_dir is nonempty, the directories will be
#       relative to the chroot directory specified;

$path = '/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/bin';

# Specify one string or a search list of strings (first match wins).
# The string (or: each string in a list) may be an absolute path,
# or just a program name, to be located via $path;
# Empty string or undef (=default) disables the use of that external program.
# Optionally command arguments may be specified - only the first substring
# up to the whitespace is used for file searching.

$file   = 'file';   # file(1) utility; use 3.41 or later to avoid vulnerability

#
# The $sa_tag_level_deflt, $sa_tag2_level_deflt and $sa_kill_level_deflt
# may also be hashrefs to hash lookup tables, to make static per-recipient
# settings possible without having to resort to SQL or LDAP lookups.

# a quick reference:
#   tag_level  controls adding the X-Spam-Status and X-Spam-Level headers,
#   tag2_level controls adding 'X-Spam-Flag: YES', and editing Subject,
#   kill_level controls 'evasive actions' (reject, quarantine, extensions);
# it only makes sense to maintain the relationship:
# tag_level <= tag2_level <= kill_level

# @av_scanners is a list of n-tuples, where fields semantics is:
#  1. av scanner plain name, to be used in log and reports;
#  2. scanner program name; this string will be submitted to subroutine
#     find_external_programs(), which will try to find the full program
#     path name; if program is not found, this scanner is disabled.
#     Besides a simple string (full program path name or just the basename
#     to be looked for in PATH), this may be an array ref of alternative
#     program names or full paths - the first match in the list will be used;
#     As a special case for more complex scanners, this field may be
#     a subroutine reference, and the whole n-tuple is passed to it as args.
#  3. command arguments to be given to the scanner program;
#     a substring {} will be replaced by the directory name to be scanned,
#     i.e. "$tempdir/parts", a "*" will be replaced by file names of parts;
#  4. an array ref of av scanner exit status values, or a regexp (to be
#     matched against scanner output), indicating NO VIRUSES found;
#  5. an array ref of av scanner exit status values, or a regexp (to be
#     matched against scanner output), indicating VIRUSES WERE FOUND;
#     Note: the virus match prevails over a 'not found' match, so it is safe
#     even if the no. 4. matches for viruses too;
#  6. a regexp (to be matched against scanner output), returning a list
#     of virus names found.
#  7. and 8.: (optional) subroutines to be executed before and after scanner
#     (e.g. to set environment or current directory);
#     see examples for these at KasperskyLab AVP and Sophos sweep.

# NOTES:
#
# - NOT DEFINING @av_scanners (e.g. setting it to empty list, or deleting the
#   whole assignment) TURNS OFF LOADING AND COMPILING OF THE ANTIVIRUS CODE
#   (which can be handy if all you want to do is spam scanning);
#
# - the order matters: although _all_ available entries from the list are
#   always tried regardless of their verdict, scanners are run in the order
#   specified: the report from the first one detecting a virus will be used
#   (providing virus names and scanner output); REARRANGE THE ORDER TO WILL;
#
# - it doesn't hurt to keep an unused command line scanner entry in the list
#   if the program can not be found; the path search is only performed once
#   during the program startup;
#
#   COROLLARY: to disable a scanner that _does_ exist on your system,
#   comment out its entry or use undef or '' as its program name/path
#   (second parameter). An example where this is almost a must: disable
#   Sophos 'sweep' if you have its daemonized version Sophie or SAVI-Perl
#   (same for Trophie/vscan, and clamd/clamscan), or if another unrelated
#   program happens to have a name matching one of the entries ('sweep'
#   again comes to mind);
#
# - it DOES HURT to keep unwanted entries which use INTERNAL SUBROUTINES
#   for interfacing (where the second parameter starts with \&).
#   Keeping such entry and not having a corresponding virus scanner daemon
#   causes an unnecessary connection attempt (which eventually times out,
#   but it wastes precious time). For this reason the daemonized entries
#   are commented in the distribution - just remove the '#' where needed.

# Section VIII - Debugging
#

# The most useful debugging tool is to run amavisd-new non-detached
# from a terminal window:
# amavisd debug

# Some more refined approaches:

# If sender matches ACL, turn debugging fully up, just for this one message
#@debug_sender_acl = ( "test-sender\@$mydomain" );
#@debug_sender_acl = qw( debug@example.com );

# May be useful along with @debug_sender_acl:
# Prevent all decoded originals being deleted (replaced by decoded part)
#$keep_decoded_original_re = new_RE( qr/.*/ );

# Turn on SpamAssassin debugging (output to STDERR, use with 'amavisd debug')
#$sa_debug = 1;            # defaults to false

#-------------
1;  # insure a defined return
