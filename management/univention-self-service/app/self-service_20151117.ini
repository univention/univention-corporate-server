# When UCS is not managing the domain but instead is only part of a Windows
# controlled Active Directory domain, the environment in which the app runs is
# different and certain services that this app relies may not not be running.
# Thus, there are issues and incompatibilities that should be stated:
# * App should not be installed in an AD (results in not being shown in the App
#   Center in such environments):
#ADMemberIssueHide=True
# * App needs a password service running on the Windows domain controller, e.g.
#   because it needs the samba hashes to authenticate users (results in a
#   warning and a link to the documentation how to set up that service in such
#   environments)
#ADMemberIssuePassword=True
