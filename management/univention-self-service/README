..

=== Packages ===
* univention-management-console-module-passwordreset: UMC module for the
    password reset plugin (to be installed on DC master or backup)
* univention-self-service: frontent base package, requirement for all plugins
    (can be installed on all UCS roles)
* univention-self-service-passwordreset: password reset plugin frontend (can
    be installed on all UCS roles)

=== Password reset sending plugins ==
As a reference three plugins are provided that can be used to send a token to a user.
A token sending plugin is a Python class that inherits from
univention.management.console.modules.passwordreset.send_plugin.UniventionSelfServiceTokenEmitter
and implements its functions.

If you wish to create a sending plugin in a different language, you can use
the provided send_with_external.py. Activate and configure it with the UCRs
* umc/self-service/passwordreset/external/enabled
* umc/self-service/passwordreset/external/command
* umc/self-service/passwordreset/external/token_length
* umc/self-service/passwordreset/external/method

Set umc/self-service/passwordreset/external/method to "email" or "sms" and deactivate
self-service/passwordreset/email/enabled or self-service/passwordreset/sms/enabled to
replace them.

=== Password reset black/white lists ===
Blacklists take precedence over whitelists.

A user on a blacklist or in a group in a blacklist cannot use the service
even if it is a whitelisted user or in a whitelisted group.

A user must be in a whitelist to use the service.
