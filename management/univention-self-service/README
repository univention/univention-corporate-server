== Univention Self Service ==
..

=== Packages ===
* univention-management-console-module-passwordreset: UMC module for the
    password reset plugin (to be installed on Primary or Backup Directory Node)
* univention-self-service: frontent base package, requirement for all plugins
    (can be installed on all UCS roles)
* univention-self-service-passwordreset: password reset plugin frontend (can
    be installed on all UCS roles)

=== Password reset sending plugins ==
As a reference three plugins are provided that can be used to send a token to a user.
A token sending plugin is a Python class that inherits from
univention.management.console.modules.passwordreset.send_plugin.UniventionSelfServiceTokenEmitter
and implements its functions.

If you wish to create a sending plugin in a different language, you can use
the provided send_with_external.py. Activate and configure it with the UCRs
* umc/self-service/passwordreset/external/enabled
* umc/self-service/passwordreset/external/command
* umc/self-service/passwordreset/external/token_length
* umc/self-service/passwordreset/external/method

Set umc/self-service/passwordreset/external/method to "email" or "sms" and deactivate
self-service/passwordreset/email/enabled or self-service/passwordreset/sms/enabled to
replace them.

=== Password reset black/white lists ===
Blacklists take precedence over whitelists.

A user on a blacklist or in a group in a blacklist cannot use the service
even if it is a whitelisted user or in a whitelisted group.

A user must be in a whitelist to use the service.

=== Email address verification ===
If you wish to verify an email address you have to import and instantiate the Client class from
univention.lib.umc. With the umc_command() function a verification email can be sent to a specific
email address. The email address can then be verified with a further call of umc_command().

Example: (send a verification email)

from univention.lib.umc import Client
c = Client()
c.umc_command(
		'passwordreset/create_self_registered_account',
		{'lastname': 'foo', 'username': 'bar', 'email': 'root@localhost', 'password': 'univention'}
	)

Within the verification email a token can be found. You have to use this token to verify the email
address as described in the example below.

Example: (verify the email address)

c.umc_command(
		'passwordreset/verify_contact',
		{'token': 'ABCDEF123456', 'username': 'bar', 'method': 'verify_email'}
	)

In UMC the verification status of the email address of a user can be seen under Password recovery in
the Users module when customizing a user.
