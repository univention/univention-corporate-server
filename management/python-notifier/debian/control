Description: a generic event scheduler providing one own implementation and adaption code for GTK+, QT and Twisted
 To be notified or to be threaded that is the question!
 As the package name may suggest, pyNotifier is a notifier/event scheduler
 abstraction written in python. It implements notification mechanisms for
 socket events (read or write) and timers. Additionally external event
 dispatchers may be called during an idle period.
