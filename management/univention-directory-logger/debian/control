Description: UCS - Directory Logger
 Univention Directory Logger is a module for the Univention Directory Listener
 that logs changes to the UCS LDAP Directory as protocol records to a log file.
 Each record reports the timestamp and kind of the modification along with
 the authentification ID (LDAP DN) of the initiator of a modification. The
 changed attributes are reported as well. Each record contains the hash value
 of the previous record to build up a chain of trusted records.
 The hash value of each new generated record is sent to the syslog where it may
 be directed to remote hosts to allow independent auditing.
 This package is part of Univention Corporate Server (UCS),
 an integrated, directory driven solution for managing
 corporate environments. For more information about UCS,
