******************
Release highlights
******************

With |UCSUCS| 5.0-9, the eight patch level release for |UCSUCS| (UCS) 5.0 is available.
It provides several feature improvements and extensions, new properties,
as well as, various improvements and bug fixes.
Here is an overview of the most important changes:

* With the release of Univention Nubus,
  UCS receives updates for icons and logos for Univention Products.
  The corresponding components within |UCSUCS| receive a visual update,
  clearly presenting their affiliation with Univention Nubus Identity and
  Access Management.

* In preparation of UCS 5.2, the repository receives a dedicated signing key.

* Apps provisioned through the |UCSUDL| mechanism process incoming changes using a file-based queue.
  With the update to 5.0-9, it's now possible to monitor the current state of the app queue,
  to identify and diagnose potential processing errors through system diagnostics.

* The RADIUS server now supports different MAC address formats for the *MAB*
  (MAC Authentication Bypass) feature.

* Enhanced UMC stability and performance for handling numerous simultaneous logins.

* UCS 5.0-9 includes various security updates, for example for
  :program:`BIND9`, :program:`docker`, :program:`OpenJDK-11`, :program:`PHP`
  and the :program:`Linux` kernel.

.. _relnotes-update:

**********************
Notes about the update
**********************

Run the update in a maintenance window, because some services in the domain may not be available temporarily.
It's recommended that you test the update in a separate test environment before the actual update.
The test environment must be identical to the production environment.

Depending on the system performance, network connection, and installed software,
the update can take anywhere from 20 minutes to several hours.
For large environments, consult :cite:t:`ucs-performance-guide`.

.. _relnotes-sequence:

Recommended update sequence for environments with more than one UCS system
==========================================================================

In environments with more than one UCS system,
take the update sequence of the UCS systems into account.

The authoritative version of the LDAP directory service operates on the |UCSPRIMARYDN|
and replicates to all the remaining LDAP servers of the UCS domain.
As changes to the LDAP schema can occur during release updates,
you must always first update the |UCSPRIMARYDN| during a release update.

.. _relnotes-32bit:

UCS only available for 64 bit
=============================

UCS 5 is only available for the x86 64 bit architecture *amd64*.
Existing 32 bit UCS systems can't update to UCS 5.

.. _relnotes-bootloader:

********************************************************
Simultaneous operation of UCS and Debian on UEFI systems
********************************************************

Please note that simultaneous operation of UCS and Debian GNU/Linux on a UEFI
system starting with UCS 5.0 isn't supported.

The reason for this is the GRUB boot loader of |UCSUCS|,
which partly uses the same configuration files as Debian.
An already installed Debian leads to the fact
that UCS can't boot (anymore) after the installation of or an update to UCS 5.0.
A subsequent installation of Debian results in UCS 5.0 not being able to boot.
For more information, refer to :uv:kb:`17768`.

.. _relnotes-localrepo:

************************
Local package repository
************************

This section is relevant for environments with a :external+uv-manual:ref:`local repository <software-create-repo>`.
The installed major version of UCS determines which packages a local repository provides.
A repository running on a UCS server with version 4.x only provides packages up to UCS 4.x,
a repository server running on UCS 5 only provides packages for UCS 5 and later.

To upgrade systems to UCS 5 in an environment with a local repository, consider the following options.
First, you need to set up a local UCS 5 repository server.

* Install a new UCS 5 system as a |UCSPRIMARYDN| from the DVD or from a virtualized base image.
  Then :external+uv-manual:ref:`setup a local repository on this system <software-create-repo>` as described in :cite:t:`ucs-manual`.

* Install a new UCS 5 system with the system role |UCSBACKUPDN|, |UCSREPLICADN| or |UCSMANAGEDNODE| from the DVD or from a virtualized base image.
  In system setup, select that the system doesn't join a domain.
  Then :external+uv-manual:ref:`set up a local repository on this system <software-create-repo>` as described in :cite:t:`ucs-manual`.
  After you updated the |UCSPRIMARYDN| used in the domain to UCS 5,
  the UCS 5 repository server can join the domain through :command:`univention-join`.

To upgrade a system in the domain to UCS 5, first update the server to the latest package level available for UCS 4.x.
Then switch the repository server used by the system to the local UCS 5 repository
by changing the |UCSUCRV| :external+uv-manual:envvar:`repository/online/server`.
You can now upgrade the system to UCS 5 through the |UCSUMC| or through the command line.

.. _relnotes-prepare:

*********************
Preparation of update
*********************

This section provides more information you need to consider before you update.

.. _relnotes-python-37-compatibility:

Python 3.7 compatibility
========================

Before you update, verify manually crafted Python code for compatibility with Python 3.7 and adjust it accordingly.
This includes |UCSUCR| templates containing Python code.
Customized AD-Connector mapping templates are an example for this.
For advice, see also the :cite:t:`developer-reference`.

.. _relnotes-ad-connector-mapping:

AD Connector mapping
====================

When you operate multiple instances of the :program:`AD Connector` as described in :ref:`uv-ext-windows:ad-multiple`,
you need to adjust the mapping configuration and ensure Python 3.7 compatibility before the update.
:uv:kb:`17754` describes the steps.

.. _relnotes-sufficient-disc-space:

Sufficient disk space
=====================

Also verify that you have sufficient disk space available for the update.
A standard installation requires a minimum of 6-10 GB of disk space.
The update requires approximately 1-2 GB additional disk space to download and install the packages,
depending on the size of the existing installation.

.. _relnotes-console-for-update:

Console usage for update
========================

For the update, sign in on the system's local console as user ``root``,
and initiate the update there.
Alternatively, you can conduct the update using |UCSUMC|.

If you want or have to run the update over a network connection,
ensure that the update continues in case of network disconnection.
Network connection interrupts may cancel the update procedure
that you initiated over a remote connection.
An interrupted update procedure affects the system severely.
To keep the update running even in case of an interrupted network connection,
use tools such as :command:`tmux`, :command:`screen`, and :command:`at`.
All UCS system roles have these tools installed by default.

.. _relnotes-pre-update-checks:

Script to check for known update issues
=======================================

Univention provides a script that checks for problems which would prevent the successful update of the system.
You can download the script before the update and run it on the UCS system.

.. code-block:: console

   # download
   $ curl -OOf https://updates.software-univention.de/download/univention-update-checks/pre-update-checks-5.0-9{.gpg,}

   # verify and run script
   $ apt-key verify pre-update-checks-5.0-9{.gpg,} && bash pre-update-checks-5.0-9

   ...

   Starting pre-update checks ...

   Checking app_appliance ...                        OK
   Checking block_update_of_NT_DC ...                OK
   Checking cyrus_integration ...                    OK
   Checking disk_space ...                           OK
   Checking hold_packages ...                        OK
   Checking ldap_connection ...                      OK
   Checking ldap_schema ...                          OK
   ...


.. _relnotes-post:

*****************************
Post processing of the update
*****************************

Following the update, you need to run new or updated join scripts.
You can either use the UMC module *Domain join*
or run the command :command:`univention-run-join-scripts` as user ``root``.

Subsequently, you need to restart the UCS system.

.. _relnotes-packages:

**************************
Notes on selected packages
**************************

The following sections inform about some selected packages regarding the update.

.. _relnotes-usage:

Collection of usage statistics
==============================

When using the *UCS Core Edition*, UCS collects anonymous statistics on the use of |UCSUMC|.
The modules opened get logged to an instance of the web traffic analysis tool *Matomo*.
Usage statistics enable Univention to better tailor the development of |UCSUMC| to customer needs and carry out usability improvements.

You can verify the license status through the menu entry
:menuselection:`License --> License information` of the user menu in the upper right corner of |UCSUMC|.
Your UCS system is a *UCS Core Edition* system, if the *License information* lists ``UCS Core Edition`` under *License type*.

UCS doesn't collect usage statistics,
when you use an `Enterprise Subscription <https://www.univention.com/products/prices-and-subscriptions/>`_
license such as *UCS Base Subscription* or *UCS Standard Subscription*.

Independent of the license used, you can deactivate the usage statistics collection by setting the |UCSUCRV| :envvar:`umc/web/piwik` to ``false``.

.. _relnotes-browsers:

Recommended browsers for the access to |UCSUMC|
===============================================

|UCSUMC| uses numerous JavaScript and CSS functions to display the web interface.
Your web browser needs to permit cookies.
|UCSUMC| requires one of the following browsers:

* Google Chrome as of version 85

* Mozilla Firefox as of version 78

* Apple Safari and Apple Safari Mobile as of version 13

* Microsoft Edge as of version 88

Users running older browsers may experience display or performance issues.
