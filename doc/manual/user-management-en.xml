        UCS integrates central identity management according to the
        <emphasis>same user, same password</emphasis> principle.
        All user information are managed
        centrally in UCS via &ucsUMC; and stored in the LDAP directory
        service.
    </para>
    <para>
        All the services integrated in the domain access the central account
        information, i.e., the same username and password are used for the
        user login to a Windows client as for the login on the IMAP server.
    </para>
    <para>
        The domain-wide management of user data reduces the administrative
        efforts as changes do not need to be subsequently configured on
		different individual systems. Moreover, this also avoids subsequent errors
		arising from inconsistencies between the individual datasets.

                            can e.g. be assigned a shorter password than would be possible according to the
                            defined minimum length. Further details on the password policies for users can

                                deactivate the user account for one or more login methods. As long as the
                                respective account type is deactivated, the user cannot log into the system. This
                                is typically used when a user leaves the company. In a heterogeneous

                            below 1000 are reserved to standard groups and other special objects.

        <title>Automatic lockout of users after failed login attempts</title>
        <para>
            As standard, a user can enter his password incorrectly any number of times. To
            hinder brute force attacks on passwords, an automatic lockout for user accounts
            can be activated after a configured number of failed log-in attempts. The lockout
            is activated locally per computer system as standard. In other words, if a
            user enters his password incorrectly too many times on one system, he can
            still login on another system. Setting the &ucsUCRV; <envar>auth/faillog/lock_global</envar>
            will make the lock effective globally and register it in the LDAP. The global
            lock can only be set on domain controller master/backup systems as other
            system roles do not possess the requisite permissions in the LDAP
            directory. On these system roles, the user is, however, locally locked or
            unlocked again via the listener module.
        </para>
        <caution>
			<para>
            This setting can also be misused, for example when a user has locked his
            screen and another user enters the password incorrectly several times in his
            absence. In this case, the user must contact the administrator to have his
            account unlocked.
			</para>
        </caution>
        <para>
            The automatic lockout of users following failed logins can be activated by
            setting the &ucsUCRV; <envar>auth/faillog</envar> to <emphasis>yes</emphasis>. The upper limit of failed log-in
            attempts at which an account lockout is activated is configured
            in the &ucsUCRV; <envar>auth/faillog/limit</envar>. The counter is reset each time the password
            is entered correctly.
        </para>
        <para>
            As standard, the <emphasis>root</emphasis> user is excluded from the password lock, but can also be
            subjected to it by setting the &ucsUCRV; <envar>auth/faillog/root</envar> to <emphasis>yes</emphasis>.
        </para>
        <para>
            As standard, the lockout is not subject to time limitations and must be reset by
            the administrator. However, it can also be reset automatically after a certain
            interval has elapsed. This is done by specifying a time period in seconds
            in &ucsUCRV; <envar>auth/faillog/unlock_time</envar>. If the value is set to 0, the lock is
            reset immediately.
        </para>
        <para>
            If accounts are locked locally, the administrator can unlock a user by
            entering the command <command>faillog -r USERNAME</command>. If the lock occurs
            globally in the LDAP, the user can be reset in
            the <guimenu>User account</guimenu> tab of a user in &ucsUDM;.

        <para>
            User templates are administrated in the UMC module <guimenu>LDAP directory</guimenu>.
            There one needs to switch to the
            <emphasis>univention</emphasis> container and then to the <emphasis>templates</emphasis>
            subcontainer. A new user template can be created here via the
            <guimenu>Add</guimenu> with the object type
            <guimenu>Settings: User template</guimenu>.
        </para>
        <para>
            In a user template, either a fixed value can be specified (e.g., for
            the address) or an attribute of the user management
            referenced. Attributes are then referenced in chevrons.
        </para>
        <para>
            A list of possible attributes can be displayed with the command:
        </para>
            <programlisting language="sh">
univention-director-manager users/user
            </programlisting>

            in the section <emphasis>users/user variables</emphasis> of the output.
        </para>
        <para>
            If a user template is used for adding a user, this template will
            overwrite all the fields with the preset values of the template. In
            doing so, an empty field is set to "".
        </para>
        <para>
            It is also possible to only use partial values of attributes or
            convert values in uppercase/lowercase.
        </para>

        <para>
		  For example, the UNIX home directory can be stored under
		  <filename>/home/&lt;title&gt;.&lt;lastname&gt;</filename> or the primary e-mail address
		  can be predefined with
		  <emphasis>&lt;firstname&gt;.&lt;lastname&gt;@firma.com</emphasis>. Substitutions are
		  generally possibly for any value, but there is no syntax or semantics check. So, if no
		  first name is specified when creating a user, the above e-mail address would begin with a
		  dot and would thus be invalid according to the e-mail standard. Similar sources of error
		  can also occur when handling file paths etc. Non-resolvable attributes (for instance due
		  to typing errors in the template) are deleted.
		</para>

        <para>
		  If only a single character of an attribute is required instead of the complete attribute
		  value, the index of the required character can be entered in the user template in square
		  brackets after the name of the attribute. The count of characters of the attribute begins
		  with 0, so that index 1 corresponds to the second character of the attribute
		  value. Accordingly, <emphasis>&lt;firstname&gt;[0].&lt;lastname&gt;@firma.com</emphasis>
		  means an e-mail address will consist of the first letter of the first name plus the lastname.
		</para>

        <para>
		  A substring of the attribute value can be defined by entering a range in square
		  brackets. In doing so, the index of the first required character and the index of the last
		  required character plus one are to be entered. For example, the input
		  <emphasis>&lt;firstname&gt;[2:5]</emphasis> returns the third to fifth character of the
		  first name.
		</para>

        <para>
		  Adding <emphasis>&lt;:lower&gt;</emphasis> or <emphasis>&lt;:upper&gt;</emphasis> to the
		  attribute name converts the attribute value to lowercase or uppercase, e.g.,
		  <emphasis>&lt;firstname:lower&gt;</emphasis>. If a modificator like
		  <emphasis>&lt;:lower&gt;</emphasis> is appended to the entire field, the complete value is
		  transformed, e.g. <emphasis>&lt;lastname&gt;@company.com&lt;:lower&gt;</emphasis>.
		</para>

        <para>
		  The option <emphasis>&lt;:umlauts&gt;</emphasis> can be used to convert special characters
		  such as è, ä or ß into the corresponding ASCII characters.
		</para>

        <para>
		  It is also possible to combine options, e.g: <emphasis>&lt;:umlauts,upper&gt;</emphasis>.
