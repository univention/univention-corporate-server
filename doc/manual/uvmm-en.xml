			&ucsUVMM; (UVMM) is a management system for virtualization servers and virtual machines.
			It offers the possibility of monitoring all the virtualization servers registered in the UCS domain and administrating the virtual instances on these systems.
		</para>
		<para>
			A &ucsUMC; module forms the management interface.
			All virtualization servers are then administrated from this management system, see <xref linkend="uvmm::management"/>).
		</para>
		<para>
			<xref linkend="uvmm::installation"/> describes the installation of the management system and the virtualization servers and the functions of the &ucsUMC; module.
		</para>
		<para>
			In principle, the virtualized systems can run arbitrary operating systems.
			This mode of operation is called <emphasis>fully virtualized</emphasis> systems.
		</para>
		<para>
			Both virtualization technologies Xen and KVM are equally supported by &ucsUVMM;.
			However, the technologies have different advantages and disadvantages depending on the host systems and hardware used.
			For example, KVM requires virtualization support in the central processing unit, while Xen can also virtualize (within limits) systems without support from the hardware.
			More detailed information can be found on their respective websites:
			<ulink url="http://www.linux-kvm.org/"/> and <ulink url="http://www.xen.org/"/>.
		</para>
		<para>
			KVM and Xen each offer interfaces to provide the virtualized systems with direct access to the resources of the virtualization server.
			This considerably improves performance.
		</para>
		<para>
			In Xen, this technology is referred to as <emphasis>paravirtualization</emphasis>.
			KVM offers the <emphasis>virtIO</emphasis> interface.
			This allows network and storage devices a direct connection to the KVM resources.
			This technology is comparable to paravirtualization.
			When menu points in UVMM refer to paravirtualization, this also includes virtIO.
		</para>
		<para>
			UVMM supports both full virtualization and paravirtualization for virtualized systems.
			Using paravirtualization/virtIO is recommended.
		</para>
		<para>
			Current Linux systems support paravirtualization as standard.
			virtIO and Xen paravirtualization drivers for Microsoft Windows are included in UCS.
			The installation is documented in <xref linkend="uvmm::gplpvvirtio"/>.
		</para>

			Univention Wiki (<ulink url="http://wiki.univention.de/"/>) includes a step-by-step quickstart guide <biblioref linkend="uvmm-quickstart"/> and further technical documentation as well as howtos <biblioref linkend="uvmm-technical-details"/>.

		<title>Installation</title>
		<para>
			&ucsUVMM; comprises three different packages.
			They can all be selected directly when installing the UCS system or alternatively installed subsequently via &ucsUMC;.
		</para>
		<variablelist>
			<varlistentry>
				<term>
					Virtual Machine Manager (UVMM) (Package: univention-virtual-machine-manager-daemon)
				</term>
				<listitem>
					<simpara>
					This package must be installed on the management system.
					In doing so, both an additional service and the &ucsUMC; module are set up.
					This package should be installed on a domain controller in the UCS domain.
					The installation on &ucsMember;s requires additional configuration steps, which are documented in <biblioref linkend="uvmm-technical-details"/>.
					If UVMM is installed on a &ucsSlave; or &ucsBackup;, the package <emphasis>univention-virtual-machine-manager-schema</emphasis> needs to be installed on the &ucsMaster; beforehand.
					</simpara>

			</varlistentry>
			<varlistentry>
				<term>
					Xen virtualization server (Package: univention-virtual-machine-manager-node-xen)
				</term>
				<listitem>
					<simpara>
					This package must be installed on each system which is to be used as a Xen-based virtualization server.
					</simpara>
				</listitem>
			</varlistentry>
			<varlistentry>
				<term>
					KVM virtualization server (Package: univention-virtual-machine-manager-node-kvm)
				</term>
				<listitem>
					<simpara>
					If KVM is to be used for the virtualization, this package should be installed on the virtualization servers.
					</simpara>
				</listitem>
			</varlistentry>
		</variablelist>
		<para>
			The two packages for the virtualization servers register the service in the LDAP directory.
			Additionally, a particular kernel is installed on Xen systems, which is necessary to allow Xen to be used.
		</para>
		<para>
			When installing the virtualization servers, only one virtualization technology should be used per server.
		</para>
		<para>
			Additionally, the architecture must also be taken into account during installation of the virtualization servers.
			64 bit systems can only be virtualized on UCS systems where are installed using the amd64 architecture.
			A 64-bit system (amd64) is recommended for use as the virtualization server.
		</para>
	</section>

	<section id="uvmm:imagefiles">
		<title>Image files of virtual machines</title>
		<para>
			If virtual hard drives are added to an instance, <emphasis>image files</emphasis> are usually used for the data keeping.
			An image file can either be generated for this purpose or an existing image file can be assigned to a virtual machine.
			Alternatively, a native block device (hard drive partition, logical volume, iSCSI volume) can be assigned to a virtual machine.
			The direct use of block devices offers performance advantages and is less susceptible to computer crashes.
		</para>
		<para>
			Hard drive images can be administrated in two ways on KVM systems;
			by default images are saved in the <emphasis>Extended format (qcow2)</emphasis>.
			This format supports Copy-on-write which means that changes do not overwrite the original version, but store new versions in different locations.
			The internal references of the file administration are then updated to allow both access to the original and the new version.
			This technique is a prerequisite for efficiently managing snapshots of virtual machines.
		</para>
		<para>
			Alternatively, you can also access a hard drive image in <emphasis>Simple format (raw)</emphasis>.
			Snapshots can only be created when using hard drive images in <emphasis>Extended format</emphasis>.
		</para>
		<para>
			Only the <emphasis>Simple format</emphasis> is available on Xen systems.
		</para>

		<para>
		  Operating systems use a so-called <emphasis>page cache</emphasis> to accelerate accesses
		  to storage media. If data are accessed which have already been read off a hard drive and
		  these data are still present in the cache, the comparatively slow access to the storage
		  medium is not necessary and the request is answered directly from the page cache.
		</para>

		<para>
		  Write accesses are generally also not directly written on the hard drive, but are usually
		  bundled and, consequently, written more efficiently. However, this involves the risk of
		  data loss, if, for example, a system crashes or the power supply is interrupted. The data
		  which have been only saved in the write cache up to that point and have yet to be
		  synchronised on the storage medium are lost. For this reasons, modern operating systems
		  generally only keep pending write changes for a maximum of several seconds before writing
		  them to the hard drive.
		</para>

		<para>
		  In order to avoid data being stored doubly in the page cache of the host system and also
		  of the guest system, cache strategies can be configured with the
		  <guimenu>Caching</guimenu> option when using KVM, which influence the use of the host
		  system's page cache:
		</para>

		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem>
				<simpara>
			  The default setting since UCS-3.1 is <emphasis>none</emphasis>: in this setting, KVM
			  accesses the hard drive directly and bypasses the page cache on the virtualization
			  server. Read accesses are answered directly by the hard drive every time and write
			  accesses are passed directly on to the hard drive.
				</simpara>
			</listitem>

			<listitem>
				<simpara>
			  The <emphasis>write-through</emphasis> strategy uses the page cache on the
			  virtualization server, but every write access is also passed on directly to the
			  storage medium. On virtualization servers with a lot of free system memory, read
			  accesses can be more efficient than <emphasis>none</emphasis>. However, the double
			  caching generally has a negative effect on the overall performance.

			  <footnote><para>Instead, it is recommended to make the free memory directly available
			  to the VMs so that they can use the additional memory more efficiently themselves, for
			  instance for caching.</para></footnote>
				</simpara>
			</listitem>

			<listitem>
				<simpara>
			  If the <emphasis>write-back</emphasis> strategy is used, the host's page cache will
			  be used for both read and write accesses. Write accesses are initially only performed
			  in the page cache, before they are then written to the hard drive at a later point in
			  time. In this case, if the host system crashes, data may be lost.
				</simpara>
			</listitem>

			<listitem>
				<simpara>
			  With the <emphasis>unsafe</emphasis> strategy, synchronisation requests sent by the
			  guest system are ignored in order to force the writing of outstanding data on the
			  storage medium explicitly. Compared with <emphasis>write-back</emphasis>, this once
			  again increases the performance, but can result in data loss if the host system
			  crashes. This version is only practical for test systems or comparable installations
			  in which data loss due to the crashing of the host system is not dramatic.
				</simpara>
			</listitem>

			<listitem>
				<simpara>
			  The <emphasis>directsync</emphasis> strategy corresponds to <emphasis>none</emphasis>,
			  with the only difference being that here synchronisation is explicitly forced after
			  every write access.
				</simpara>
			</listitem>

			<listitem>
				<simpara>
			  The <emphasis>Hypervisor default</emphasis> option is dependent on the UCS version and
			  the KVM version with which a guest system was installed: Originally, the standard
			  value until UCS 3.0 was implicitly <emphasis>write-through</emphasis>, but KVM was
			  modified to such an extent with UCS 3.1 that <emphasis>none</emphasis> is now used for
			  all old VMs instead. For VMs resaved with UCS 3.1 the standard value is implicitly
			  <emphasis>write-through</emphasis> again, but new VMs are explicitly saved with
			  <emphasis>none</emphasis>.
				</simpara>
			</listitem>
		</itemizedlist>

		<para>
		  Xen uses its own system called Tapdisk, which bypasses the guest's page cache similarly
		  to <emphasis>none</emphasis>.
		</para>

		<para>
			These image files are stored in so-called storage pools. They can either be stored
			locally on the virtualization server or on a file share.
		</para>
		<para>
			If a live migration of virtual machines between different virtualization servers is planned, the storage pool must be stored on a system which can be accessed by all virtualization servers (e.g., an NFS share or an iSCSI target).
			This is described in <biblioref linkend="uvmm-technical-details"/>.
		</para>
		<para>
			Image files are created as sparse files with the specified size, i.e., these files only grow when they are used and then up to the maximally specified size and thus initially require only minimal disk space.
			As there is a risk here of the disk space being used up during operation, a Nagios monitoring should be integrated, see <xref linkend="nagios::general"/>.

	  <title>Accessing the default storage pool through a file share</title>

		  Each virtualization server provides a storage pool with the name

		</para>

		<para>
		  To allow simple access to the storage pool, you can set up a share for the
