All these services are provided by Samba in UCS. Two different Samba
versions can be employed in UCS:
</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para><emphasis>Samba 3</emphasis> implements domain services based on the domain
technology of Microsoft Windows NT. Samba 3 is the current, stable and
tried-and-tested main release series of the Samba project and has been
integrated in UCS for many years.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para><emphasis>Samba 4</emphasis> is the next generation of the Samba suite. The
most important innovation of Samba 4 is the support of domain,
directory and authentication services which are compatible with
Microsoft Active Directory. This means that Active
Directory-compatible Windows domains can be constructed with Samba
4. These also allow the use of the tools provided by Microsoft for the
management of users or group policies (GPOs) for example. The versions
of Samba 4 currently published by the Samba project are expected to
undergo more intensive changes in their further development than Samba
3. Univention has tested the required components for the provision of Active
Directory-compatible domain services with Samba 4 and integrated them
in UCS in close cooperation with the Samba team. Parallel to this,
Samba 3 was integrated with Samba 4 for UCS. This means that the
tried-and-tested file and print service of Samba 3 can be used at the
same time as the use of Active Directory-compatible domain services.</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>
An overview of the functional differences between Samba 3 and Samba 4
can be found in the Univention Wiki <biblioref linkend="wiki-samba4"/>.
</para>
<para>
In addition to Samba 4, UCS also integrates an additional component
for the syncronisation with Active Directory (AD): the Univention Active
Directory Connector. In contrast to Samba 4, however, this operates a
separate AD domain based on Microsoft Windows, which can be
bidirectionally or unidirectionally synchronised, see
<xref linkend="ad-connector:general"/>.
</para>

<section id="windows:Installation_and_components_of_a_Samba_domain"><title>Installation and components of a Samba domain</title>
<para>
A Samba domain is composed of at least one domain controller.
Windows clients and UCS &ucsMember;s can join the trust context of
the Samba domain as domain members.
Such servers do not provide login services, but may offer file and
print services, for example. Login to these servers is then performed
against the UCS user data. UCS-based &ucsMember;s are only provided
via Samba 3.
</para>
<para>
Domain joining of Windows clients is described in
<xref linkend="windows-domaenenbeitritt"/>.
</para>
<para>
Windows domain controllers can neither join the domain with Samba 3
nor with Samba 4. This function is planned for Samba 4 at a later
point in time.
</para>
<para>
The name of the Samba domain is specified during installation of
the &ucsMaster;, depending on whether Samba is installed on the
system or not. The name of the domain is saved in
the &ucsUCRV; <envar>windows/domain</envar>.
</para>
<para>
Samba 4 can not join an Active Directory Forest yet at this
point. (For Samba 3 this function is not available because of
the lack of support for the Active Directory technology.)

<para>
Samba 4 implements Active Directory directory services which allow a multi-master replication, i.e.,
the writing changes of several domain controllers are synchronised at protocol level. Consequently,
the use of snapshots in virtualization solutions should be avoided when using Samba 4 and Samba 4
should be operated on a server which is never switched off or suspended.

<section id="windows:Services_of_a_Samba_domain"><title>Services of a Samba domain</title>
<section id="windows:Authentication_services"><title>Authentication services</title>
<para>
In Samba 3, the user passwords are saved in the UCS LDAP. Users are
authenticated against the LDAP directory when logging into the domain
with their username and password, and can then access all the shared
resources of the domain without having to enter their username and
password again. Computers with any kind of Windows operating systems
are authenticated in the same way as in Windows NT domains, via the
NTLMv2 protocol.
</para>
<para>
Users who log on to a Windows system joined in a Samba 4 server are supplied with a
Kerberos ticket when they log on. The ticket is then used for the further
authentication. This ticket allows access to the domain's
resources. Synchronisation of the system times is essential for
functioning Kerberos authentication.
</para>
<para>
User logins can only be performed on Microsoft Windows systems joined
in the Samba domain. Domain joins are documented in
<xref linkend="windows-domaenenbeitritt"/>.
</para>
<para>
Mixed environments containing both Samba 3 and Samba 4 are only
supported for update scenarios and are described in more detail
in the Univention Wiki <biblioref linkend="wiki-samba-update"/>.
</para>
</section>

<section id="windows:fileservices">
  <title>File services</title>
  <para>
	The file services integrated in UCS support the provision of shares using the CIFS protocol (see
	<xref linkend="shares::general"/>). Insofar as the underlying file system supports Access
	Control Lists (ACLs) (can be used with ext3, ext4 and XFS), the ACLs can also be used by Windows
	clients. Samba 4 requires a file system with XATTR support.
  </para>

  <para>
	Samba 4 domain controllers can also provide file services. As a general rule, it is recommended
	to separate domain controllers and file/print services in Samba environments - the same as the
	recommendations for Active Directory - that means using domain controllers for
	logins/authentication and member services for file/print services. This ensures that a high
	system load on a file server does not result in disruptions to the authentication service. For
	smaller environments in which it is not possible to run two servers, file and print services can
	also be run on a domain controller.
  </para>

  <para>
	In versions before UCS 3.2, Samba used the CIFS protocol to provide file services. In new
	installations as of UCS 3.2, the successor SMB2 is enabled as standard. Using a client which
	supports SMB2 (as of Windows Vista, i.e., Windows 7/8 too) improves the performance and
	scalability.
  </para>

  <para>
	The protocol can be configured using the &ucsUCR; variable <envar>samba/max/protocol</envar>. It
	must be set on all Samba servers and then all Samba server(s) restarted.

<para>
Samba offers the possibility of sharing printers set up under Linux as
network printers for Windows clients. The management of the printer
shares and the integration of the printer drivers is described in
<xref linkend="print::general"/>.
</para>
<para>
Samba 4 domain controllers can also provide print services. In this case, the restrictions described
in <xref linkend="windows:fileservices"/> must be taken into consideration.
</para>
</section>

<section id="windows:s4connector"><title>Univention S4 connector / Samba 4 LDAP directory</title>
<para>
  In Samba 4, the Samba user accounts are managed completely bySamba. Samba 4 provides a separate
  LDAP directory service. The synchronisation between the UCS LDAP and the Samba LDAP occurs via an
  internal system service, the Univention S4 connector.
</para>

<para>
  Further information on the status of the synchronisation can be found in the log file
  <filename>/var/log/univention/connector-s4.log</filename>.

<para>
  The command <command>unvention-s4connector-list-rejected</command> lists all objects which cannot
  be synchronised.
</para>

<para>
  The <command>univention-s4search</command> command can be used to search in the Samba directory
  service. <command>univention-s4search</command> is a wrapper for the command
  <command>ldbsearch</command>. If it is run as the <emphasis>root</emphasis> user, the required

<section id="windows:sysvolshare">
  <title>Synchronisation of the SYSVOL share</title>
  <para>
	The SYSVOL share is a share which provides group policies and logon scripts in Active Directory
	/ Samba 4. It is synchronised among all domain controllers and stored in the
	<filename>/var/lib/samba/sysvol</filename> directory.
  </para>

  <para>
	In Microsoft Active Directory, the SYSVOL share is synchronised by the File Replication Service
	(introduced with Windows 2000) or the Distributed File System (as of Windows 2008 R2). These
	replication methods are not yet fully implemented in Samba 4. The synchronisation between
	the Samba 4 domain controllers is performed in UCS via a Cron job (every five minutes as
	standard - can be configured using the &ucsUCRV; <envar>samba4/sysvol/sync/cron</envar>).
  </para>
</section>


<section id="windows:NetBIOS_name_service"><title>NetBIOS name service</title>
<para>
Windows systems use NetBIOS, a TCP/IP-based network protocol for
resolving host names and for network communication. Samba provides
NetBIOS functions with the <emphasis>nmbd</emphasis> system service.
</para>
<para>
NetBIOS computer names can have a maximum of 13 characters. The
NetBIOS name of a UCS system corresponds to the host name by
default. A different name can be configured with
the &ucsUCRV; <envar>samba/netbios/name</envar> and alias names defined with
the &ucsUCRV; <envar>samba/netbios/aliases</envar>.
</para>
<para>
In a native Active Directory environment, there are no NetBIOS
services provided as standard. In an AD environment based on Samba 4,
however, it is activated. This can be deactivated with
the &ucsUCRV; <envar>samba4/service/nmb</envar>.
</para>
<para>
Samba 3 and Samba 4 offer the same scope of functions in terms of
NetBIOS services.
</para>
</section>

<section id="windows:wins"><title>Name resolution using WINS</title>
<para>
Similar to DNS in TCP/IP networks, the <emphasis>Windows Internet Name
Service (WINS)</emphasis> is used for resolving NetBIOS names into IP
addresses. In addition, WINS provides information on the services of
the hosts.
</para>
<para>
WINS is used in Samba 3-based, NT-compatible domains; in Samba 4
domains, the name resolution generally occurs via DNS.
</para>
<para>
The WINS service can also be provided by Samba. WINS support is
activated on the &ucsMaster; in the default setting and can also be
operated on another server by setting the &ucsUCRV; <envar>windows/wins-support</envar>. WINS can only be operated without
adjustments on one Samba server in the domain; distribution across
several servers requires the setup of WINS replication. Information
on the commissioning of the WINS replication can be found in the
Univention Support database at <ulink url="http://sdb.univention.de/1107"/>.

  <title>UCS Active Directory Connector</title>
  <section id="ad-connector:einfuehrung">
	<title>Introduction</title>
	<para>
	  The UCS Active Directory Connector (AD Connector for short) makes it possible to synchronise
	  directory service objects between a Windows 2003/2008/2012 server under Active Directory (AD)
	  and a &ucsUCS;. The connector can also synchronise several AD domains with one UCS domain;
	  this is documented in <xref linkend="ext-doc-win"/>).
	</para>

	<para>
	  In the default setting, containers, organisational units, users, and groups are
	  synchronised. Users have an exceptional position since the password cannot be queried via the
	  LDAP protocol in Active Directory. A special service is installed on the Windows server for
	  this purpose, which enables password synchronisation (see <xref
	  linkend="ad-connector:password-dienst"/>).
	</para>

	<para>
	  Information on the attributes configured in the basic setting and
	  particularities to take into account can be found in the
	  <xref linkend="ad-connector:details-zur-vorkonfigurierten-synchronisation"/>.
	</para>

	<para>
	  Computer accounts are not synchronised since Windows clients can only
	  be a member in one domain.
	</para>

	<para>
	  Users can make access to services of both environments in a
	  transparent way; this is due to the possibility of having the same
	  user settings in both domains. After logging into a UCS domain, a
	  subsequent connection to a file share or to an Exchange server with
	  Active Directory is possible without a renewed password request. Users
	  and administrators will find users and groups of the same name on the
	  resources of the other domain, and can thus work with their familiar
	  permission structures.
	</para>

	<para>
	  The initialisation is performed after the first start of the
	  connector. All the entries are read out of the UCS, converted in AD
	  objects according to the mapping set and added (or modified if already
	  present) on the UCS side. All objects are then read out of the AD and
	  converted into UCS objects before being added/modified
	  accordingly. The directory service servers are then queried further
	  as long as no changes have been made. The AD connector can also be
	  operated in a unidirectional mode.
	</para>

	<para>
	  Following the initial sync, additional changes are requested at a set interval.
	  This interval is initially set to five seconds and can be adapted via
	  the &ucsUMC; configuration module.
	</para>

	<para>
	  If an object cannot be synchronised, it is "rejected". During
	  start-up of the UCS AD connector, an attempt is made to write
	  this object again. In addition, a further attempt is made to input the
	  object again after several runs. The interval can be configured in the
	  UMC configuration module, see <xref linkend="ad-connector:basicsetup"/>.
	  The presetting specifies ten cycles before the object is resynchronised.
	  A restart of the UCS AD connector also triggers a resynchronisation of
	  all previously rejected changes.
