		Univention Corporate Server offers a cross platform domain concept with a
		common trust context between Linux and/or Windows systems. Within this domain
		a user is known to all systems via his username and password stored in the
		&ucsUMS; and can use all services which are authorised for him. The management
		system keeps the account synchronised for the windows log-in, Linux/Posix
		systems and Kerberos. The management of user accounts is described in
		<xref linkend="users:general"/>.
	</para>
	<para>
		All UCS and Windows systems within a UCS domain have a host domain
		account. This allows system-to-system authentication. Domain joining is
		described in <xref linkend="domaenenbeitritt"/>.
	</para>
	<para>
		The certificate authority (CA) of the UCS domain is operated on the
		&ucsMaster;. A SSL certificate is generated there for every system that has
		joined the domain. Further information can be found in <xref
		linkend="domain:ssl"/>.
	</para>
	<para>
		Every computer system which is a member of a UCS domain has a system role. This
		system role represents different permissions and restrictions, which are
		described in <xref linkend="systemrollen"/>.
	</para>
	<para>
		All domain-wide settings are stored in a directory service on the basis of
		OpenLDAP. <xref linkend="domain:ldap"/> describes how to expand the
		managed attributes with LDAP scheme expansions, how to set up an
		audit-compliant LDAP documentation system and how to define access permissions
		to the LDAP directory.
	</para>
	<para>
		Replication of the directory data within a UCS domain occurs via the Univention
		Directory Listener/Notifier mechanism. Further information can be found in
		<xref linkend="domain:listenernotifier"/>.
	</para>
	<para>
		Kerberos is an authentication framework the purpose of which is to permit
		secure identification in the potentially insecure connections of decentralised
		networks. Every UCS domain operates its own Kerberos trust context
		(realm). Further information can be found in <xref
		linkend="domain:kerberos"/>.

	<title>Joining domains</title>
	<para>
		A UCS, Ubuntu or Windows system must join the domain after installation. The
		following describes the different possibilities to do this:

	<para>
	  In addition to UCS, Ubuntu and Mac OS X, arbitrary Unix systems can be integrated into the

		<title>How UCS systems join domains</title>
		<para>
			There are three possibilities for a UCS system to join an existing domain;
			directly after installation in the Univention Installer (see <xref
			linkend="installation:Domäneneinstellungen:EinerUCSDomäneBeitreten"/>) or subsequently using the command
			<command>univention-join</command> or using &ucsUMC;.
		</para>
		<para>
			The &ucsMaster; should always be installed at the most up-to-date release stand
			of the domains, as problems can arise with an outdated domain control master
			when a system using the current version joins.
		</para>
		<para>
			When a computer joins, a computer account is created, the SSL certificates are
			synchronised and an LDAP copy is initiated if necessary. The <emphasis>join
			scripts</emphasis> are also run at the end of the join process. These register
			further objects, etc., in the directory service using the software packages
			installed on the system (see <xref linkend="domain-ldap:joinscripts"/>).
		</para>
		<para>
			The joining of the domain is registered on the client side in the
			<filename>/var/log/univention/join.log</filename> log file, which can be used
			for reference in error analysis. Actions run on the domain controller master
			are stored in the
			<filename>/home/&lt;Join-Account&gt;/.univention-server-join.log</filename> log
			file.
		</para>
		<para>
			The joining process can be repeated at any time. Systems may even be required
			to rejoin following certain administrative steps (such as changes to important
			system features on the &ucsMaster;).

	  <title>Windows domain joins</title>
	  <para>
		The procedure for joining a Windows system to a UCS domain made available via Samba is now
		described for Windows 7/8 and Windows 2012. The process is similar for other
		Windows versions. In addition to the client versions, Windows server systems can also join
		the domain. Windows servers join the domain as member servers; joining a Windows systems as
		a domain controller is not supported.
	  </para>

	  <para>
		Only domain-compatible Windows versions can join the UCS domain, i.e., it is not possible for the Home versions of Windows to join a domain.
	  </para>

	  <para>
		Two different versions of Samba can be used in UCS: Samba 3 implements a Windows domain
		based on NT domain technology, while Samba 4 implements an Active Directory
		directory. Further information can be found in <xref linkend="windows:general"/>.
	  </para>

	  <para>
		A host account is created for the Windows client automatically when it joins the domain (see
		<xref linkend="computers::hostaccounts"/>). Information concerning MAC and IP addresses, the
		network, DHCP or DNS can be configured in &ucsUMC; prior to or after joining the domain.
	  </para>

	  <para>
		Domain joining is usually performed with the local Administrator account on the Windows
		system.
	  </para>

	  <para>
		Joining the domain takes some time and the process must not be cancelled prematurely. After
		successful joining a small window appears with the message <guimenu>Welcome to the domain
		&lt;domain name&gt;</guimenu>. This should be confirmed with
		<mousebutton>OK</mousebutton>. The computer must then be restarted for the changes to take
		effect.

	  <para>
		Domain names must be limited to 13 characters as they are otherwise truncated at the Windows
		client and this can lead to log-in errors.
	  </para>

	  <para>
		For a domain join against a domain controller based on Samba 3, it must be ensured that the

	  </para>

	  <para>
		For a domain join against a domain controller based on Samba 4, the DNS configuration of the

		manually (this can be done using the UMC modules <guimenu>App Center</guimenu>
		or <guimenu>Package Management</guimenu>).
		For example, if the mail component was installed on the previous DC
		master, it is not automatically on the new DC master after the conversion.
	</para>
	<para>
		If additional LDAP schema packages were installed on the &ucsMaster;, they must
		also be installed on the &ucsBackup; prior to the conversion.
		The package list of the old &ucsMaster; should be saved prior to the promotion in order to
		allow subsequent comparison of the installed packages. The package list can be created with
		the following command:
	  <programlisting language="sh">
COLUMNS=200 dpkg --list &gt; packagelist.txt
	  </programlisting>
	  In addition, the &ucsUCR; inventory needs to be saved so that it is possible to compare the
	  configuration adjustments on the new &ucsMaster;. This can be achieved with the following
	  command:
	</para>
	  <programlisting language="sh">
ucr dump &gt; ucr.txt
	  </programlisting>
	<para>
		The conversion of a DC backup to the new DC master is performed by running the
		<command>/usr/lib/univention-ldap/univention-backup2master</command> command.
		The system must be rebooted after the conversion. The process is logged in the
		<filename>/var/log/univention/backup2master.log</filename> log file.
	</para>

	<para>
	  The computer name and/or the IP address of the &ucsMaster; is automatically changed to the new name in all
	  configurations managed from the UCS LDAP or via &ucsUCR; in the scope of the promotion. If the
	  name is referenced in configuration files or on systems which are not managed by &ucsUCR;, it must be adapted
	  accordingly following the promotion.
