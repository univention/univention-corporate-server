	<title>Management of computer accounts in the Univention Management Console</title>
	<para>
		All UCS, Linux and Windows systems within a UCS domain each have a
		computer domain account (also referred to as the host account) with which the
		systems can authenticate themselves among each other and with which they can
		access the LDAP directory.
	</para>
	<para>
		The computer account is generally created automatically when the system
		joins the UCS domain (see <xref linkend="domaenenbeitritt"/>); however,
		the computer account can also be added prior to the domain join.
	</para>

	<para>
	  The password for the computer account is generated automatically during the domain join and
	  saved in the <filename>/etc/machine.secret</filename> file.  In the default setting, the
	  password consists of 20 characters (can be configured via the &ucsUCRV;
	  <envar>machine/password/length</envar>). The password is regenerated
	  automatically at fixed intervals (default setting: 21 days; can be configured using the
	  &ucsUCRV; <envar>server/password/interval</envar>). Password rotation can also be disabled
	  using the variable <envar>server/password/change</envar>.
	</para>

	<para>
		There is an different computer object type for every system role. Further
		information on the individual system roles can be found in <xref
		linkend="systemrollen"/>.
	</para>
	<para>
		Computer accounts are managed in the <guimenu>Computers</guimenu> module of
		the &ucsUMC;.
	</para>

	<para>
	  In the default setting, a simplified wizard for creating a computer is shown, which only requests
	  the most important settings. All attributes can be shown by clicking on
	  <guimenu>Advanced</guimenu>. If there is a DNS forward zone and/or a DNS reverse zone (see
	  <xref linkend="networks:dns"/>) assigned to the selected network object (see <xref
	  linkend="networks::introduction"/>), a host record and/or pointer record is automatically
	  created for the host. If there is a DHCP service configured for the network object and a MAC
	  address is configured, a DHCP host entry is created (see <xref linkend="module:dhcp:dhcp"/>).
	</para>

	<para>
	  The simplified wizard can be disabled for all system roles by setting the &ucsUCRV;
	  <envar>directory/manager/web/modules/computers/computer/wizard/disabled</envar> to
	  <emphasis>true</emphasis>.

			The default kernel in UCS for i386-based systems is the so-called
			<emphasis>bigmem kernel</emphasis> for processors with PAE support, which

		<para>
			The boot process occurs in two steps using an initial ramdisk ('initrd' for
			short). This is composed of an archive with further drivers and programs.
		</para>
		<para>
			The GRUB boot manager (see <xref linkend="grub"/>) loads the kernel and
			the initrd into the system memory, where the initrd archive is extracted and
			mounted as a temporary root file system. The real root file system is then
			mounted from this, before the temporary archive is removed and the system start
			implemented.
		</para>
		<para>
			The drivers to be used are recognised automatically during system start and
			loaded via the udev device manager. At this point, the necessary device links
			are also created under <filename>/dev/</filename>. If drivers are not
			recognised (which can occur if no respective hardware IDs are registered or
			hardware is employed which cannot be recognised automatically, e.g., ISA
			boards), kernel modules to be loaded can be added via &ucsUCRV;
			<envar>kernel/modules</envar>. If more than one kernel module is to be loaded,
			these must be separated by a semicolon. The &ucsUCRV; <envar>kernel/blacklist</envar>
			can be used to configure a list of one or more kernel modules for which automatic
			loading should be prevented. Multiple entries must also be separated by a semicolon.
		</para>
		<para>
			Unlike other operating systems, the Linux kernel (with very few exceptions)
			provides all drivers for hardware components from one source. For this reason,
			it is not normally necessary to install drivers from external sources
			subsequently.
		</para>
		<para>
		  However, if external drivers / kernel modules are required, they can be integrated via the
		  DKMS framework (Dynamic Kernel Module Support). This provides a standardised interface for
		  kernel sources, which are then built automatically for every installed kernel (insofar as
		  the source package is compatible with the respective kernel). For this to happen, the
		  kernel header package <emphasis>univention-kernel-headers</emphasis> must be
		  installed in addition to the <emphasis>dkms</emphasis> package. Please note that not all
		  the external kernel modules are compatible with all kernels.

				  dynamic assignment. One network card can be used for different IPv6 addresses. The

				  The most common application scenario for <emphasis>bridging</emphasis> is the
				  shared use of a physical network card by one or more virtual machines. Instead of
				  one network card for each virtual machine and the virtualization server
				  itself, all systems are connected via a shared uplink. A bridge can be compared

				  together. The hardware network adapter used is called a <emphasis>bridge

				  If the bridge is used to connect two ethernet networks, the spanning tree
				  protocol (STP) is employed to avoid network loops
				  <footnote><para>
					The Linux kernel only implements STP, not the Rapid STP or Multiple STP versions.

				  The <guimenu>Forwarding delay</guimenu> setting configures the waiting time in
				  seconds during which information is collected about the network topology when a
				  connection is being made via STP. If the bridge is used for connecting virtual machines to
				  one physical network card, STP should be disabled by setting the value to
				  0. Otherwise problems may occur when using DHCP, as the packets sent during the
				  waiting time are not forwarded.

	<section id="ucr::templates::extend">
		<title>Modifying UCR templates</title>
		<para>
			In the simplest case, a &ucsUCR; template is a copy of the original
			configuration file in which the points at which the value of a variable are to
			be used contain a reference to the variable name.
		</para>
		<para>
			Inline Python code can also be integrated for more complicated scenarios, which
			then also allows more complicated constructions such as conditional
			assignments.
		</para>
		<note>
			<para>
			&ucsUCR; templates are included in the corresponding software packages as
			configuration files. When packages are updated, a check is performed for
			whether any changes have been made to the configuration files. If configuration
			files are no longer there in the form in which they were delivered, they will
			not be overwritten. Instead a new version will be created in the same directory
			with the ending <emphasis>.debian.dpkg-new</emphasis>. If changes are to be
			made on the &ucsUCR; templates, these templates are also not overwritten during
			the update and are instead resaved in the same directory with the ending
			<emphasis>.dpkg-new</emphasis> or
			<emphasis>.dpkg-dist</emphasis>. Corresponding notes are written in the
			<filename>/var/log/univention/actualise.log</filename> log file. This only
			occurs if UCR templates have been locally modified.
			</para>
		</note>
		<para>
			The UCR templates are stored in the
			<filename>/etc/univention/templates/files</filename> directory. The path to the
			templates is the absolute path to the configuration file with the prefixed path
			to the template directory. For example, the template for the
			<filename>/etc/issue</filename> configuration file can be found under
			<filename>/etc/univention/templates/files/etc/issue</filename>.
		</para>
		<para>
			For the configuration files to be processed correctly by &ucsUCR; they must be
			in UNIX format. If configuration files are edited in DOS or Windows, for
			example, control characters are inserted to indicate line breaks, which can
			disrupt the way &ucsUCR; uses the file.
		</para>

		<section id="ucr::templates::extend::simple">
			<title>Referencing of UCR variables in templates</title>
			<para>
				In the simplest case, a UCR variable can be directly referenced in the
				template. The variable name framed by the string <emphasis>@\%@</emphasis>
				represents the wildcard. As an example the option for the activation of X11
				forwarding in the configuration file <filename>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</filename>
				of the OpenSSH server:
			</para>
			<programlisting>
X11Forwarding @%@sshd/xforwarding@%@

				templates; additional registration is only required with the use of inline
				Python code (see <xref linkend="ucr::templates::extend::python"/>).
			</para>
		</section>

		<section id="ucr::templates::extend::python">
			<title>Integration of inline Python code in templates</title>
			<para>
				Any type of Python code can be embedded in UCR templates by entering a code
				block framed by the string <emphasis>@!@</emphasis>. For example, these blocks
				can be used to realise conditional requests so that when a parameter is changed
				via a variable, further dependent settings are automatically adopted in the
				configuration file. The following code sequence configures for example network
				settings using the &ucsUCR; settings:
			</para>
			<programlisting>
@!@
if configRegistry.get('apache2/ssl/certificate'):

			<para>
				All the data output with the print function are written in the generated
				configuration file. The data saved in &ucsUCR; can be requested via the
				configRegistry object, e.g.:
			</para>
			<programlisting>
@!@
if configRegistry.get('version/version') and \
        configRegistry.get('version/patchlevel'):
    print 'UCS %(version/version)s-%(version/patchlevel)s' % \
        configRegistry
@!@
			</programlisting>
			<para>
				In contrast to directly referenced UCR variables (see <xref
				linkend="ucr::templates::extend::simple"/>), variables accessed in inline
				Python code must be explicitly registered.
			</para>
			<para>
				The &ucsUCR; variables used in the configuration files are registered in
				<emphasis>info</emphasis> files in the
				<filename>/etc/univention/templates/info</filename> directory which are usually
				named after the package name with the file ending
				<emphasis>.info</emphasis>. If new Python code is entered into the templates or
				the existing code changed in such a way that it requires additional or
				different variables, one of the existing <emphasis>.info</emphasis> files will

		<para>
			Data of the NSS service is cached by the <emphasis>Name Server Cache
			Daemon</emphasis> (NSCD) in order to speed up frequently recurring requests for
			unchanged data. Thus, if a repeat request occurs, instead of a complete LDAP
			request to be processed, the data are simply drawn directly from the cache.
		</para>

		<para>
		  Since UCS 3.1, the groups are no longer cached via the NSCD for performance and
		  stability reasons; instead they are now cached by a local group cache, see <xref
		  linkend="groups::cache"/>.
		</para>

		<para>
			The central configuration file of the (<filename>/etc/nscd.conf</filename>) is

		</para>
		<para>
			The access to the cache is handled via a hash table. The size of the hash table
			can be specified in &ucsUCR;, and should be higher than the number of
			simultaneously used users/hosts. For technical reasons, a prime number
			should be used for the size of the table. The following table shows the
			standard values of the variables:

		<para>
			With very big caches it may be necessary to increase the size of the cache
			database in the system memory. This can be configured through the &ucsUCR;
			variables <envar>nscd/hosts/maxdbsize</envar>,
			<envar>nscd/group/maxdbsize</envar> and <envar>nscd/passwd/maxdbsize</envar>.
		</para>

			As standard, five threads are started by NSCD. In environments with many
			accesses it may prove necessary to increase the number via the &ucsUCRV;
			<envar>nscd/threads</envar>.
		</para>
		<para>
			In the basic setting, a resolved group or host name is kept in cache for one
			hour, a user name for ten minutes. With the &ucsUCR; variables
			<envar>nscd/group/positive_time_to_live</envar> and
			<envar>nscd/passwd/positive_time_to_live</envar> these periods can be extended
			or diminished (in seconds).

			From time to time it might be necessary to manually invalidate the cache of the

			When installing a UCS system, an SSH server is also installed per

			wherein the identity of a host can be assured via a check sum. Essential
			aspects of the SSH server's configuration can be adjusted in &ucsUCR;.

				If the &ucsUCRV; <envar>sshd/permitroot</envar> is set to

				will be performed for the <emphasis>root</emphasis> user, but only a login
				based on a public key. By this means brute force attacks to passwords can be

		<para>
			The &ucsUCRV; <envar>sshd/xforwarding</envar> can be used to configure whether
			an X11 output should be passed on via SSH. This is necessary, for example, for

			<emphasis>yes</emphasis> and <emphasis>no</emphasis>.
		</para>
