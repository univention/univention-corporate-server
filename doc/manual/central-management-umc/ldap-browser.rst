.. _central-navigation:

LDAP directory browser
======================

The UMC module :guilabel:`LDAP directory` can be used to navigate through the
LDAP directory. When doing so, new objects can be created, modified or deleted
in the LDAP directory.

   Navigating the LDAP directory

The left half of the screen shows the LDAP directory as a tree structure whose
elements can be shown and hidden using the arrow icons.

Clicking on an element of the tree structure switches to this LDAP position and
displays the objects at this LDAP position in the in the right side of the
screen. The *Type* selection list can be used to limit the display to
selected attributes.

The :guilabel:`Add` button can be used to add new objects here too. Similar to
the control elements described in :ref:`central-user-interface`, existing
objects can also be edited, deleted or moved here.

   Editing LDAP container settings

Right-clicking on an element in the tree structure allows editing the properties
of the container or the LDAP base with :guilabel:`Edit`.
