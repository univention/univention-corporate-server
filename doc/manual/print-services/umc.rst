   Printer administration

The start page of the module contains a search mask with which the available
printers can be selected. The result list displays the server, name, status,
location and description of the respective printer. The status of more than one
printer can be changed simultaneously by selecting the printers and running
either the *deactivate* or *activate* function.

Clicking on the printer name displays details of the selected printer. The
information displayed includes a list of the print jobs currently in the printer
queue. These print jobs can be deleted from the queue by selecting the jobs and
running the *Delete* function.
