	<title>Introduction and structure</title>
	<para>
	With the help of the Nagios software, it is possible to verify the
	correct function of complex IT structures from networks, computers and
	services continually and automatically.
	</para>

	<para>
	Nagios has a comprehensive collection of monitoring modules, the
	so-called Nagios plugins. In addition to polling system indicators
	(e.g., CPU and memory utilisation, free disk space), they also allow
	to test the availability and function of different services
	(e.g., SSH, SMTP, HTTP). Simple program steps such as the delivery of
	a test e-mail or the resolution of a DNS record are generally
	performed for the function tests. In addition to the standard plugins
	included in Nagios, the UCS-specific plugins are also provided, with
	which the listener/notifier replication can be monitored, for example.
	</para>

	<para>
	Nagios differentiates between three basic operating statuses for a service:
	</para>

	<itemizedlist>
		<listitem>
			<simpara>
			<emphasis>OK</emphasis> is regular operation
			</simpara>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
			<simpara>
			<emphasis>CRITICAL</emphasis> describes an error, e.g., a web server which
			cannot be reached
			</simpara>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
			<simpara>
			<emphasis>WARNING</emphasis> signals the possibility of an error status
			occurring soon and is thus a precursor of <emphasis>CRITICAL</emphasis>.
			Example: The test for sufficient free disk space on the root partition only
			triggers an error as of 90% full, but a warning is given as of 75%.
			</simpara>
		</listitem>
	</itemizedlist>

	<para>
	When the operating status changes, a contact person specified in
	advance can be informed of the possible malfunction.
	In addition to the reactive notification in case of error, the current
	status can also be checked at any time continually in a web-based
	interface in which the status information is displayed in a compact
	manner.
	</para>

		<title>Nagios status webinterface</title>
		<graphic scalefit="1" align="center" width="90%" fileref="illustrations40/nagios_service_detail.png"/>
	</figure>

	<para>
	Nagios is composed of three main components:
	</para>

	<itemizedlist>
		<listitem>
			<simpara>
		The core component of a Nagios installation is the <emphasis>Nagios server</emphasis>,
		which is responsible for the collection and storage of the monitoring data.
			</simpara>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
			<simpara>
		The actual collection of the status information is performed by
		<emphasis>Nagios plugins</emphasis>, which are run at regular intervals by the
		Nagios server. The information gathered is saved on the Nagios server.
			</simpara>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
			<simpara>
		Some status information cannot be requested over the network
		(e.g., the query of free disk space on a hard drive partition). In
		this case, the NRPED service (Nagios Remote Plugin Executor Daemon)
		is used, which runs Nagios plugins on another computer following a
		request from the Nagios server and then transfers the gathered
		information. The NRPED is provided by the <emphasis>Nagios client</emphasis>
		component, which is preinstalled on all UCS system roles.
		<emphasis>Nagios client</emphasis>
			</simpara>
		</listitem>
	</itemizedlist>

	<para>
	The Nagios configuration is performed in &ucsUMC;, the Nagios
	configuration files are automatically generated from the information
	stored in the LDAP directory.
	</para>
</section>


<section id="Nagios:Installation">
	<title>Installation</title>

	<para>
	  A Nagios server can be installed from the Univention App Center with the application
	  <emphasis>Network monitoring (Nagios)</emphasis>. Alternatively, the software package
	  <package>univention-nagios-server</package> can be installed (subsequently
	  <command>univention-run-join-scripts</command> must be run). Additional information can be
	  found in <xref linkend="computers::softwaremanagement::installsoftware"/>. The Nagios server
	  can be installed on any system role; the use of a domain controller system is recommended.
	  The Nagios client is installed by default on all system roles.
	</para>

	<para>
	In addition to the standard plugins provided with the installation of
	the <emphasis>univention-nagios-client</emphasis> package, additional plugins can
	be subsequently installed with the following packages:
	</para>

	<itemizedlist>
		<listitem>
			<simpara>
			<emphasis>univention-nagios-raid</emphasis> Monitoring of the software RAID status
			</simpara>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
			<simpara>
			<emphasis>univention-nagios-smart</emphasis> Test of the S.M.A.R.T. status of hard drives
			</simpara>

			<emphasis>univention-nagios-opsi</emphasis> Test of software distribution OPSI

		<listitem>
			<simpara>
			<emphasis>univention-nagios-ad-connector</emphasis> Test of the AD Connector
			</simpara>
		</listitem>
	</itemizedlist>

	<para>
	Some of the packages are automatically set up during installation of
	the respective services. For example, if the UCS
	AD connector is set up, the monitoring plugin is included
	automatically.
	</para>

	<section id="nagios:preconfiguredchecks">
		<title>Preconfigured Nagios checks</title>
		<para>
		During the installation, basic Nagios tests are set up

<section id="nagios:newplugins">
  <title>Integration of additional plugins</title>
  <para>
	The preconfigured Nagios plugins supplied with UCS can be complemented with additional
	plugins. A variety of available modules can be found at <ulink url="http://exchange.nagios.org"/>.
  </para>

  <para>
	This section describes the integration of an external plugin taking the plugin
	<command>check_e2fs_next_fsck</command> as an example. The plugin checks whether a file system
	check is scheduled and emits a warning if one is scheduled within seven days and an error status
	if a file system check is scheduled for the next reboot.
  </para>

  <para>
	The installation differs depending on whether the plugin is run via NRPE or not:
  </para>
	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem>
		<simpara>
		  If the plugin is run via NRPE, it must be copied into the
		  <filename>/usr/lib/nagios/plugins</filename> directory on all Nagios servers and on all
		  the systems to be checked.
		</simpara>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
		<simpara>
		  If the plugin does not require local access, it need only be copied into the
		  <filename>/usr/lib/nagios/plugins</filename> directory on the Nagios server(s).
		</simpara>
	  </listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
  <para>
	The plugin must be marked as an executable file (<command>chmod a+x PLUGIN</command>).
  </para>

  <para>
	Some plugins are exclusively written in Perl, Python or Shell and do not require any external
	libraries or programs. These interpreters are always installed on all UCS systems. In contrast,
	if the plugin uses external programs or libraries, it must be ensured that these are installed
	on all the systems to be checked (for NRPE plugins) or on the Nagios servers (for remote plugins).
  </para>

  <para>
	The Nagios plugin must now be registered. This is done using a macro in the
	<filename>/etc/nagios-plugins/config/</filename> directory. For this, a file such as
	<emphasis>local.cfg</emphasis> can be used, in which all the locally registered plugins are
	entered. The following example registers the plugin <command>check_e2fs_next_fsck</command>:
  </para>
<programlisting language="sh">
define command{
  command_name   check_fsck
  command_line   /usr/lib/nagios/plugins/check_e2fs_next_fsck
}
</programlisting>

  <para>
	Many plugins also use parameters to configure the thresholds for warnings and errors. These are
	determined in the <emphasis>command_line</emphasis> line.
	Similarly to the plugin itself, the macro file must also be copied onto all the systems to be
	monitored when using NRPE.
	The plugins, macros and any dependencies can also be bundled in a Debian package. Further
	information is available in <biblioref linkend="developer-reference"/>.
  </para>

  <para>
	The Nagios service must now be restarted:
  </para>
<programlisting language="sh">
/etc/init.d/nagios3 restart
</programlisting>

  <para>
	The new plugin then only needs to be registered in &ucsUMC; as a
	<guimenu>Nagios service</guimenu>, see <xref linkend="Nagios:Dienst"/>. The name registered under
	<emphasis>command_name</emphasis> in the macro file must be entered as the
	<guimenu>Plugin command</guimenu>, in this example <command>check_fsck</command>, and the
	option <guimenu>Use NRPE</guimenu> enabled.
	The newly registered service can now be assigned to individual systems, see <xref
	linkend="nagios::hostconfig"/>.
  </para>
