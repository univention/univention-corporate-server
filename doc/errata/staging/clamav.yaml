desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * A vulnerability in CHM file parser could allow an unauthenticated, remote
   attacker to cause a denial of service condition. (CVE-2022-20770)
 * A vulnerability in the TIFF file parser could allow an unauthenticated,
   remote attacker to cause a denial of service condition. (CVE-2022-20771)
 * A vulnerability in HTML file parser could allow an unauthenticated, remote
   attacker to cause a denial of service condition. (CVE-2022-20785)
 * A vulnerability in the regex module used by the signature database load
   module could allow an authenticated, local attacker to crash ClamAV at
   database load time, and possibly gain code execution. The vulnerability is
   due to improper bounds checking that may result in a multi-byte heap buffer
   overwflow write. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by placing a
   crafted CDB ClamAV signature database file in the ClamAV database
   directory. An exploit could allow the attacker to run code as the clamav
   user. (CVE-2022-20792)
 * A vulnerability could allow an authenticated, local attacker to cause a
   denial of service condition on an affected device. (CVE-2022-20796)
note: For a description of teh vulnerabilities, see the ClamAV blog.
