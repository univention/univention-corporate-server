fix: 1.0.9-16
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * New commands have been added to `univention-keycloak` to create
   attribute mappers from the LDAP object to the internal Keycloak
   object (`user-attribute-ldap-mapper`) and to create
   user attribute mappers and nameid mappers for SAML clients
   (`saml-client-user-attribute-mapper`,
   `saml-client-nameid-mapper`).
 * `SimpleSAMLPHP` is configured as a service provider in `Keycloak`,
   meaning it acts as a proxy and use `Keycloak` as a backend. This is
   part of the migration from `SimpleSAMLPHP` to `Keycloak` in `UCS`.
