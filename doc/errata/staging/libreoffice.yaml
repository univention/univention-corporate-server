 * Team upload by ELTS security team.
 * Fix CVE-2024-6472: Certificate Validation user interface in LibreOffice
   allows potential vulnerability. Signed macros are scripts that have been
   digitally signed by the developer using a cryptographic signature. When a
   document with a signed macro is opened a warning is displayed by
   LibreOffice before the macro is executed. Previously if verification failed
   the user could fail to understand the failure and choose to enable the
   macros anyway.
