 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * The synchronization of the password hashes was implemented by using a 
   service which was installed on the Microsoft Active Directory server. The
   Univention AD Connector now uses different interfaces of the Active
   Directory for reading and writing the password hashes. That means, the UCS
   AD Connector service which is installed on the Microsoft Active Directory                                                                                                                    
   server can be stopped after installing this update.
