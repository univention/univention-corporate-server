 This update addresses the following issue:
 * Split low-level C implementation from Python binding to simplify transition
   to using `dh_python2` and adding Python3 support.
 * Unify pure-python version `debug2.py` again with C-version `debug.py`.
 * Deprecate `function` class in favor of `trace` decorator.
