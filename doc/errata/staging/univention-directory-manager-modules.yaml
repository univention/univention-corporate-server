fix: 15.0.11-38A~5.0.0.202203211721
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * When user templates were members of groups an error was raised
   which prevented opening or modifying that group. Templates as
   group members are now ignored in UDM module `groups/group`.
 * Moving of `users/ldap` objects is possible again. This was broken
   due to the Python 3 migration in UCS 5.0.
 * Two resource sharing conflicts on Python dictionaries have been
   fixed, that could lead to tracebacks when modules are reloaded
   in a multithreaded context.
 * It is now possible to search for the user expiry date of `users/user`
   objects.
 * Searching with patterns containing umlauts is possible again.
 * When removing a policy the policy is removed from the referencing objects.
 * Backend functionality for service specific passwords has been added. It
   cannot be used via CLI.
 * The performance of the license check has been improved to reduce
   the initial login time.
