 This update addresses the following issue:
 * The Samba dlz_bind9 module didn't properly handle zone reloads.
   The next request after a zone reload triggered a segementation fault.
   After that named/bind9 was automatically restarted via runit, so the
   crash went unnoticed in most cases. Now the zone reload is fixed.
