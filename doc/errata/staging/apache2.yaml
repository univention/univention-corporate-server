fix: 2.4.25-3+deb9u19A~4.4.9.202409301010
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * Substitution encoding issue in mod_rewrite in Apache HTTP Server allows
   attacker to execute scripts in directories permitted by the configuration
   but not directly reachable by any URL or source disclosure of scripts
   meant to only to be executed as CGI. Some RewriteRules that capture and
   substitute unsafely will now fail unless rewrite flag "UnsafeAllow3F" is
   specified. (CVE-2024-38474)
 * Improper escaping of output in mod_rewrite in Apache HTTP allows an
   attacker to map URLs to filesystem locations that are permitted to be
   served by the server but are not intentionally/directly reachable by any
   URL, resulting in code execution or source code disclosure. Substitutions
   in server context that use a backreferences or variables as the first
   segment of the substitution are affected. Some unsafe RewiteRules will be
   broken by this change and the rewrite flag "UnsafePrefixStat" can be used
   to opt back in once ensuring the substitution is appropriately
   constrained. (CVE-2024-38475)
