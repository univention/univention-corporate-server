 This update addresses the following issues:
 2.4.25-3+deb9u19 (Wed, 18 Sep 2024 15:45:11 +0000)
 * Non-maintainer upload by the ELTS team.
 * Adds RewriteOption "LegacyPrefixDocRoot": When a substitution is a fully
   qualified URL, and the scheme/host/port matches the current virtual host,
   stop interpreting the path component as a local path just because the first
   component of the path exists in the filesystem. Adds RewriteOption
   "LegacyPrefixDocRoot" to revert to previous behavior.
 * Fix CVE-2024-38474: Substitution encoding issue in mod_rewrite in Apache
   HTTP Server allows attacker to execute scripts in directories permitted by
   the configuration but not directly reachable by any URL or source
   disclosure of scripts meant to only to be executed as CGI. Some
   RewriteRules that capture and substitute unsafely will now fail unless
   rewrite flag "UnsafeAllow3F" is specified.
 * Fix CVE-2024-38475: Improper escaping of output in mod_rewrite in Apache
   HTTP allows an attacker to map URLs to filesystem locations that are
   permitted to be served by the server but are not intentionally/directly
   reachable by any URL, resulting in code execution or source code
   disclosure. Substitutions in server context that use a backreferences or
   variables as the first segment of the substitution are affected. Some
   unsafe RewiteRules will be broken by this change and the rewrite flag
   "UnsafePrefixStat" can be used to opt back in once ensuring the
   substitution is appropriately constrained.
 * Fix CVE-2024-38474 regression
