desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * CVE-2024-36387: Serving WebSocket protocol upgrades over a `HTTP/2`
   connection could result in a Null Pointer dereference, leading to a crash
   of the server process.
 * CVE-2024-38476: `SSRF` or local script execution via backend applications
   whose response headers are malicious or exploitable
 * CVE-2024-38477: a NULL pointer dereference was found in `mod_proxy`
   allowing an attacker to crash the server via a malicious request.
 * CVE-2024-38573: A potential SSRF in `mod_rewrite` allowed an attacker to
   cause unsafe RewriteRules to unexpectedly setup URL's to be handled by
   `mod_proxy`.
 * CVE-2024-39884: A regression of CVE-2024-38476 in the core of Apache
   HTTP Server ignores some use of the legacy content-type based configuration
   of handlers. "AddType" and similar configuration, under some circumstances
   where files are requested indirectly, result in source code disclosure of
   local content. For example, PHP scripts may be served instead of
   interpreted.
 * CVE-2024-40725: A partial fix for CVE-2024-38476 in the core of Apache
   HTTP Server ignores some use of the legacy content-type based configuration
   of handlers. "AddType" and similar configuration, under some circumstances
   where files are requested indirectly, result in source code disclosure of
   local content. For example, PHP scripts may be served instead of
   interpreted.
