desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * A new LDAP attribute has been introduced with 5.0-1 erratum 100. As
   re-indexing is time consuming the decision was made to delay the indexing
   until 5.0-2 and not to do it via n errata update. Therefore, a manual fix
   for customers is available and the required steps are documented at
   <http://help.univention.com/t/19248>.
 * A new UCR variable "ldap/translog-ignore-temporary" has been created
   to control if UDM temporary objects should be considered for replication
   by the Listener/Notifier mechanism. This variable is applicable only to the
   UCS Primary Directory Node. For new installations the default is "yes"
   For updated UCS systems it will not be activated autoamtically.
 * The french translations of UDM extended attributes have been updated.
