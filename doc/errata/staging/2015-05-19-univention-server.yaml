version: [2]
desc: |
  This update addresses the following issues:
  * The UCR variable 'ldap/server/addition' is used to configure additional
    LDAP servers in case the primary LDAP server is unavailable. The setting
    can be configured through a UMC policy 'LDAP server'.
    Previously the so configured value was written into the NORMAL layer of the
    Univention Configuration Registry, which overwrote any setting configured
    by the user.
    The value is now written into the LDAP layer, which has a higher priority
    than the NORMAL layer and thus overrules any local configuration, but
    preserves the user configured setting.
    The value can still be overwritten locally by using the FORCED layer of
    UCR, e.g. "ucr set --force ldap/server/addition=...".
    Setting the UCR variable through a UMC policy 'Univention Configuration
    Registry' is not recommended and will clash with the 'LDAP server' policy.
