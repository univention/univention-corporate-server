 This update addresses the following issues:
 * If a client application that creates additional database connections only
   reuses the basic connection parameters while dropping security-relevant
   parameters, an opportunity for a man-in-the-middle attack, or the ability
   to observe clear-text transmissions, could exist. The highest threat from
   this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as
   system availability (CVE-2020-25694)
 * An attacker having permission to create non-temporary objects in at least
   one schema can execute arbitrary SQL functions under the identity of a
   superuser. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data
   confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability
   (CVE-2020-25695)
 * psql \gset allows overwriting specially treated variables (CVE-2020-25696)
