desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 1:2.3.4.1-5+deb10u8 (Wed, 28 Aug 2024 00:53:14 +0200)
 * Non-maintainer upload by the ELTS Security Team.
 * Fix CVE-2024-23185: Very large headers can cause resource exhaustion when
   parsing message.
 * Backport upstream change to parse multiple address headers the same as if
   they were in a single header. Upstream argues this is better from security
   point of view.
 * Backport upstream changes for CVE-2024-23184: Having a large number of
   address headers (From, To, Cc, Bcc, etc.) could become excessively CPU
   intensive.
