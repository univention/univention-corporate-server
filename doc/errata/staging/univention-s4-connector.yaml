desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue:
 * Joining UCS@School replica servers into environments with many objects
   could fail due to timeouts in the join scripts
   `97univention-s4-connector`,`98univention-samba4-dn` and
   `98univention-squid-samba4`. The synchronisation of existing objects
   delayed the synchronisation of new objects which are created during the
   join and necessary for its completion. The S4-Connector and the join
   scripts have been modified to sync these vital objects first, which speeds
   up the join process considerably.
