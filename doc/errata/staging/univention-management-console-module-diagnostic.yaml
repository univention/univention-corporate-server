fix: 4.0.1-7A~4.3.0.201810101315
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * Improved logging of diagnostic module actions
 * A new diagnostic plugin has been added that scans through LDAP and finds
   objects that lack a univentionObjectType although they should have one.
   The plugin also allows to migrate those objects. Having a
   univentionObjectType allows for other services to use a convenient LDAP
   filter.
