 * Non-maintainer upload by the ELTS Security Team.
 [Roberto C. Sánchez]
 * Fix CVE-2021-46659: an application crash existed because MariaDB does not
   recognize that SELECT_LEX::nest_level is local to each VIEW
 [Bastien Roucariès]
 * Fix CVE-2022-21427: An Easily exploitable vulnerability allowed high
   privileged attacker with network access via multiple protocols to
   compromise MariaDB Server. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can
   result in unauthorized ability to cause a hang or frequently repeatable
   crash (complete DOS). Certain UTF8 combining marks cause MariaDB to crash
   when doing Full-Text searches.
 * Fix CVE-2022-24048, CVE-2022-24051, CVE-2022-24052: MariaDB CONNECT Storage
   Engine Stack-based Buffer Overflow Privilege Escalation Vulnerability. This
   vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected
   installations of MariaDB. Authentication is required to exploit this
   vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the processing of SQL
   queries. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length
   of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based
   buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges
   and execute arbitrary code in the context of the service account. Concerned
   storage Engine were JSON, XML, MYSQL.
 * CVE-2022-24050: MariaDB CONNECT Storage Engine Use-After-Free Privilege
   Escalation Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows local attackers to
   escalate privileges on affected installations of MariaDB. Authentication is
   required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the
   processing of SQL queries. The issue results from the lack of validating
   the existence of an object prior to performing operations on the object. An
   attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute
   arbitrary code in the context of the service account.
 * CVE-2022-27380: An issue in the component my_decimal::operator= of MariaDB
   Server was discovered to allow attackers to cause a Denial of Service (DoS)
   via specially crafted SQL statements.
 * CVE-2022-27383: An use-after-free was found in the component
   my_strcasecmp_8bit, which is exploited via specially crafted SQL
   statements.
 * Fix CVE-2022-27384, CVE-2022-32083 An issue in the component
   Item_subselect::init_expr_cache_tracker allow attackers to cause a Denial
   of Service (DoS) via specially crafted SQL statements.
 * Fix CVE-2022-27387: a global buffer overflow in the component
   decimal_bin_size was found, which is exploited via specially crafted SQL
   statements.
 * Fix CVE-2022-27448: There is an Assertion failure via 'node->pcur->rel_pos
   == BTR_PCUR_ON'. This could lead to a crash in multi-update and implicit
   grouping
 * Fix CVE-2022-31622: Fix a Denial of Service. When an error occurs
   (pthread_create returns a nonzero value) while executing the method
   create_worker_threads, the held lock is not released correctly, which
   allows local users to trigger a denial of service due to the deadlock
