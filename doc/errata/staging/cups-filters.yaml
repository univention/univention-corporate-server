fix: 1.11.6-3+deb9u3
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * CVE-2024-47076: The `cfGetPrinterAttributes5` function in `libcupsfilters`
   does not sanitize IPP attributes returned from an IPP server. When these
   IPP attributes are used, for instance, to generate a PPD file, this can
   lead to attacker controlled data to be provided to the rest of the CUPS
   system.
 * CVE-2024-47176: `cups-browsed` binds to `INADDR_ANY:631`, causing it to
   trust any packet from any source, and can cause the
   `Get-Printer-Attributes` IPP request to an attacker controlled URL. When
   combined with other vulnerabilities, such as CVE-2024-47076,
   CVE-2024-47175, and CVE-2024-47177, an attacker can execute arbitrary
   commands remotely on the target machine without authentication when a
   malicious printer is printed to.
