desc: |
  This update addresses the following issue:
  * An API change introduced in erratum 217 and a UDM module move in
    erratum 236 led to UDM/UMC problems on UCS systems with an UCS
    version prior to 4.0-2 errata level 217.
    The UDM module policies/mailquota is now able to use the old and
    the new API.
