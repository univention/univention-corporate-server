 This update addresses the following issues:
 * Since updating from Kernel 4.19 to Kernel 5.10 the behavior of the `xfs`
   filesystem seems to have changed with respect to the handling of xattrs.
   As a symptom, `rsync -aAX` as used by the script `sysvol-sync.sh`
   seems to remove `trusted.SGI_ACL_FILE` and `trusted.SGI_ACL_DEFAULT`
   when synchronizing from the sysvol from a system with an `ext4` partition,
   which doesn't have those, but only the usual `system.posix_acl_access` and
   `system.posix_acl_default`. The script `sysvol-sync.sh` has been adjusted
   to filter the syncronized xattrs to only consider `security.NTACL` and
   not touch any other xattrs.
