fix: 9.0.14-5
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * Under certain conditions, installation of `univention-samba4`
   aborted because of a missing package dependency on a specific
   version of `samba-dsdb-modules`, when an older version of that
   package was already installed.
   This is addressed by making `univention-samba4` depend on the
   metapackage `samba-ad-dc` instead, and letting that manage
   a versioned dependency on `samba-dsdb-modules`. This simplifies
   the package depenencies.
