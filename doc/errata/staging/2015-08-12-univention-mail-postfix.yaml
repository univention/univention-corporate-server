version: [3]
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * DH parameters are not created at installation time any more.
   Precalculated DH parameters for 512 and 2048 bit are provided.
   A one time generation of DH parameters is scheduled for the next day.
 * The default of the UCR variable mail/postfix/cron/recreate/dh/parameter
   is changed to not recreate the DH parameters every night. The cronjob of
   existing installations is not changed.
 * The activation of mail/postfix/policy/listfilter lead to the mail server
   rejecting all emails. This has been fixed.
 * A configuration error prevented Postfix from sending emails if Dovecot
   was also installed. Postfix' smtp client now always uses the Cyrus SASL
   implementation.
