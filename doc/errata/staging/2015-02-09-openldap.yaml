 Two vulnerabilities have been fixed in OpenLDAP:
 * If the slapo-deref overlay is used (which is not the case in 
   a standard UCS installation) and if the list of attributes 
   to be dereferenced is left empty, slapd can be crashed 
 * Malformed search filters could result in a crash of the
   slapd
