  This update fixes serveral issues:
  * The local UCR variable uuid/license is now removed if the key ID is missing
    in the UCS license.
  * univention-add-app no longer registers a link in the UCS startsite and
    removes the component again if called with --master (just like the App
    Center module)
  * The component installation status is now transferred via apt-get user agent.
