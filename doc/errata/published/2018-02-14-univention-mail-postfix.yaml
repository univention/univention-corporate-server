 This update addresses the following issues:
 * The listfilter policy service can now write debugging information to the
   mail log, when the UCR variable mail/postfix/policy/listfilter/debug is
   set to "yes" (Bug #44922).
 * The content of the files main.cf.local and master.cf.local will now be
   appended to /etc/postfix/main.cf and /etc/postfix/master.cf respectively.
   After editing the *.local files, ucr commit /etc/postfix/*.cf must be
   called (Bug #44473).
 * If mail/postfix/policy/listfilter/use_sasl_username=yes was set, the
   listfilter policy service rejected all mail unexpectedly. The listfilter
   policy service has been fixed and now handles Cyrus SASL authentication
   correctly (Bug #45422).
 * Postfix' service postscreen has been integrated and can be configured
   via the UCR variables prefixed by mail/postfix/postscreen/. The service
   performs lightweight checks on incoming SMTP connections to reject e.g.
   spam early (Bug #45607).
