desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * Unspecified vulnerability in Oracle Java SE allows remote attackers to
   affect confidentiality via unknown vectors (CVE-2015-2632)
 * Unspecified vulnerability in Oracle Java SE allows remote attackers to
   affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability via unknown vectors
   (CVE-2015-4844).
 * The uloc_acceptLanguageFromHTTP function in common/uloc.cpp in
   International Components for Unicode (ICU) for C/C++ does not ensure
   that there is a '\0' character at the end of a certain temporary array,
   which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
   (out-of-bounds read) or possibly have unspecified other impact
   via a call with a long httpAcceptLanguage argument (CVE-2016-6293)
 * buffer overflow problem in uresbund.c (CVE-2014-9911)
 * stack-based buffer overflow in the Locale class via a long locale string
   (CVE-2016-7415)
 * out-of-bounds write caused by a heap-based buffer overflow related to the
   utf8TextAccess function in common/utext.cpp and the utext_setNativeIndex*
   function (CVE-2017-7867)
 * out-of-bounds write caused by a heap-based buffer overflow related to the
   utf8TextAccess function in common/utext.cpp and the utext_moveIndex32*
   function (CVE-2017-7868)
