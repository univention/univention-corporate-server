fix: 1.25-2.21.201608291233
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * The stringprep_utf8_to_ucs4 function in libidn before 1.31, as used
   in jabberd2 and other applications, allows context-dependent
   attackers to read system memory and possibly have other unspecified
   impact via invalid UTF-8 characters in a string, which triggers an
   out-of-bounds read (CVE-2015-2059)
 * Solve out-of-bounds-read when reading one zero byte as input
   (CVE-2015-8948)
 * out-of-bounds stack read in idna_to_ascii_4i (CVE-2016-6261)
 * stringprep_utf8_nfkc_normalize reject invalid UTF-8 (CVE-2016-6263)
