fix: 1:5.5p1-6.45.201404071444
desc: |
 Two vulnerabilities were fixed in OpenSSH:
 * The AcceptEnv option was misparsed if it contained a wildcard (CVE-2014-2532)
 * OpenSSH offers a feature to retrieve SSH hostkeys from DNS called SSHFP (not enabled in 
   UCS by default). If the clients rejected the host certificate of a SSHFP-enabled server,
   then no SSHFP record was fetched from DNS (CVE-2014-2653)
note: This update fixes these vulnerabilities.
