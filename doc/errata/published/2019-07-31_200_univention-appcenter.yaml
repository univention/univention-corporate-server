desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * The app badges icons in the App Center are replaced with new versions.
 * A new App Setting "DockerUcrStyleEnv" was added to be able to deactivate
   passing environment variables into docker containers that are not in the 
   format of capital letters and underscores.
 * An errata update caused the App Tab in the Users UMC module to not be
   visible. This update resyncs the listener so that the App Tab is visible
   again.
