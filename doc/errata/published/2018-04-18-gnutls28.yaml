desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * Double free vulnerability in the gnutls_x509_ext_import_proxy function
   allows remote attackers to have unspecified impact via crafted policy
   language information in an X.509 certificate with a Proxy Certificate
   Information extension. (CVE-2017-5334)
 * The stream reading functions in lib/opencdk/read-packet.c allow remote
   attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-memory error and crash) via
   a crafted OpenPGP certificate. (CVE-2017-5335)
 * Stack-based buffer overflow in the cdk_pk_get_keyid function in
   lib/opencdk/pubkey.c allows remote attackers to have unspecified impact via
   a crafted OpenPGP certificate. (CVE-2017-5336)
 * Multiple heap-based buffer overflows in the read_attribute function allow
   remote attackers to have unspecified impact via a crafted OpenPGP
   certificate. (CVE-2017-5337)
 * GnuTLS is vulnerable to a NULL pointer dereference while decoding a status
   response TLS extension with valid contents. This could lead to a crash of
   the GnuTLS server application. (CVE-2017-7507)
 * GnuTLS has an out-of-bounds write caused by an integer overflow and
   heap-based buffer overflow related to the cdk_pkt_read function in
   opencdk/read-packet.c. This issue is a subset of the vendor's
   GNUTLS-SA-2017-3 report. (CVE-2017-7869)
