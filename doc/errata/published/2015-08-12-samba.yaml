fix: 2:4.2.3-1.788.201508261727
version: [2,3]
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * The Samba dlz_bind9 module didn't properly handle zone reloads.
   The next request after a zone reload triggered a segmentation fault.
   After that named/bind9 was automatically restarted via runit, so the
   crash went unnoticed in most cases. Now the zone reload is fixed.
 * Windows 2008 R2 Foundation raises error popup after join. This issue has
   been fixed previously but was not part of the last Samba version.
 * NetApp filer NAS devices joined to a Samba/AD DC failed to lookup SIDs
   due to an issue in negotiating strong encryption for server
   authentication. This issue has been fixed previously but was not part of
   the last Samba version.
 * Samba is now build with the embedded Heimdal code to avoid memory
   management issues with the external Heimdal libraries.
 * The unattended Windows sysprep join failed against Samba 4. This issue
   has been fixed.
