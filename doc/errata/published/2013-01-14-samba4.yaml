 This errata update fixes the following issues:
  * Samba 4 may provide authenticated users with write access to LDAP
    directory objects. If a user or a group the user is a member of has any
    access based on the objectClass, then that user has write access to that
    object.  Additionally, if a user has write access to any attribute on
    the object, they may have access to write to all attributes. This errata
    update fixes this issue (CVE-2013-0172).
  * samba-tool classicupgrade doesn't create userPrincipalNames
  * DRS replication failed in IPv6-only environments
