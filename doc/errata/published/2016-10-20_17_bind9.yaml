desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue:
 * incorrect validation of DNSSEC-signed records in the Bind DNS server could
   result in denial of service (CVE-2015-5722)
 * Responses with a malformed class attribute can trigger an assertion failure
   in db.c (CVE-2015-8000)
 * Denial of service due to INSIST failure in apl_42.c triggered by specific
   APL RR data (CVE-2015-8704)
 * Denial of service due to maliciously crafted rdnc command (CVE-2016-1285)
 * Denial of service (crash) due to DNAME parsing error (CVE-2016-1286)
 * buffer.c in named does not properly construct responses, which allows
   remote attackers to cause a denial of service (assertion failure and daemon
   exit) via a crafted query. (CVE-2016-2776)
