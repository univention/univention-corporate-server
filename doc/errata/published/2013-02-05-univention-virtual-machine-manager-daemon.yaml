  This errata update fixes several issues:

    This has been fixed.

  * Floppies are now by default attached read-only.
  * Empty drives are allowed for snapshots.
  * Removing empty drives no longer asks for deleting the volume.
  * Snapshot operations are still accessible even when
    non-snapshotable images are attached.
