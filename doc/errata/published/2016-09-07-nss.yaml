desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * The sec_asn1d_parse_leaf function improperly restricts access to an
   unspecified data structure (CVE-2015-7181)
 * Heap-based buffer overflow in the ASN.1 decoder (CVE-2015-7182)
 * The s_mp_div function in lib/freebl/mpi/mpi.c in improperly divides
   numbers, which might make it easier for remote attackers to defeat
   cryptographic protection mechanisms (CVE-2016-1938)
 * Heap-based buffer overflow allows remote attackers to execute
   arbitrary code via crafted ASN.1 data in an X.509 certificate
   (CVE-2016-1950)
 * Use-after-free vulnerability in the
   ssl3_HandleECDHServerKeyExchange function allows remote attackers
   to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other
   impact by making an SSL (1) DHE or (2) ECDHE handshake at a time of
   high memory consumption (CVE-2016-1978)
 * Use-after-free vulnerability in the
   PK11_ImportDERPrivateKeyInfoAndReturnKey function allows remote
   attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified
   other impact via crafted key data with DER encoding (CVE-2016-1979)
 * With TLS protocol 1.2 and earlier, when a DHE_EXPORT ciphersuite is
   enabled on a server but not on a client, does not properly convey a
   DHE_EXPORT choice, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to
   conduct cipher-downgrade attacks by rewriting a ClientHello with
   DHE replaced by DHE_EXPORT and then rewriting a ServerHello with
   DHE_EXPORT replaced by DHE, aka the "Logjam" issue.
   The solution in nss was to not accept bit lengths less than
   1024. This may potentially be a backwards incompatibility issue but
   such low bit lengths should not be in use so it was deemed
   acceptable. (CVE-2015-4000)
 * Mozilla Network Security Services (NSS) before 3.23, as used in
   Mozilla Firefox before 47.0, allows remote attackers to cause a
   denial of service (memory corruption and application crash) or
   possibly have unspecified other impact via unknown
   vectors. (CVE-2016-2834)
