fix: 2:4.10.1-1A~4.4.0.201908281834
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * This update fixes an issue in the samba-tool ntacl sysvolcheck command
   where it complains about a difference in the "P", "PAR" or "PAI"
   NTACL flags when comparing LDAP directory ACLs to the sysvol.
 * Fix for Samba4.10 Regression: idmap uid to sid failed for accounts with
   uid in range 300000-400000
 * Under certain parameter configurations, when an SMB client accesses a
   network share and the user does not have permission to access the share
   root directory, it is possible for the user to escape from the share
   to see the complete '/' filesystem. Unix permission checks in the kernel
   are still enforced (CVE-2019-10197)
