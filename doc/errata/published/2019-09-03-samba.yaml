 This update addresses the following issue:
 * Under certain parameter configurations, when an SMB client accesses a
   network share and the user does not have permission to access the share
   root directory, it is possible for the user to escape from the share
   to see the complete '/' filesystem. Unix permission checks in the kernel
   are still enforced (CVE-2019-10197).
