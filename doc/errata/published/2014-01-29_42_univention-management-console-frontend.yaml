 This update fixes several issues:
 * The protocol of a printer URI in the printers UMC module was always set to
   "cups-pdf://".

 * Reversed the traceback when sending errors via mail since the web or mail
   client could truncate important information.
 * Fixed MultiSelect widget setting its values too early which could break page
   rendering.
