   FT_Done_Glyph function (from FreeType 2) is called at an incorrect place
   in the ImageMagick code (CVE-2017-14989)
 * NULL pointer dereference vulnerability in ReadEnhMetaFile in coders/emf.c
   (CVE-2017-15016)
 * NULL pointer dereference vulnerability in ReadOneMNGImage in coders/png.c
   (CVE-2017-15017)
 * ReadGIFImage in coders/gif.c leaves the palette uninitialized when
   processing a GIF file that has neither a global nor local palette. If the
   affected product is used as a library loaded into a process that operates
   on interesting data, this data sometimes can be leaked via the
   uninitialized palette (CVE-2017-15277)
 * ReadPSDImage in coders/psd.c allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
   service (application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via
   a crafted file, related to "Conditional jump or move depends on
   uninitialised value(s)" (CVE-2017-15281)
 * The HorizontalFilter function in resize.c allows remote attackers to cause
   a denial of service (out-of-bounds read) via a crafted image file
   (CVE-2014-8354)
 * PCX parser code allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
   (out-of-bounds read) (CVE-2014-8355)
 * DCM decode 6.8.9-9 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
   (out-of-bounds read) (CVE-2014-8562)
 * The JPEG decoder allows local users to cause a denial of service
   (out-of-bounds memory access and crash) (CVE-2014-8716)
 * The ReadGROUP4Image function in coders/tiff.c does not check the return
   value of the fwrite function, which allows remote attackers to cause a
   denial of service (application crash) via a crafted file (CVE-2016-10062)
