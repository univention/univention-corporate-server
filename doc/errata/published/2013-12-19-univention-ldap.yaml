version: [0]
desc: |
  This errata update fixes several issues:
  * The LDAP indices are now generated for all combinations of LDAP search
    types configured via UCR "ldap/index/*".
  * The encoding of UCR policies changed so that values can also contain
    umlauts.
  * The LDAP ACLs now support the configuration of a
    custom Administrator name via the new UCR variable family
    "users/default/.*". These variables are managed automatically by
    a Univention Directory Listener module (introduced via erratum 30 for
    UCS 3.2) and should usually not be adjusted manually.
  * New schema extension for MS WMI filters.
  * The local schema inclusion code now detects extensions included by
    template subfiles.
