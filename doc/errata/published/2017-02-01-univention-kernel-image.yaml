desc: |
 This update of the Linux kernel to 4.1.38 addresses the following issues:
 * The rfcomm_sock_bind function in net/bluetooth/rfcomm/sock.c in the Linux
   kernel before 4.2 allows local users to obtain sensitive information or
   cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference) via vectors involving
   a bind system call on a Bluetooth RFCOMM socket. (CVE-2015-8956)
 * The proc_keys_show function in security/keys/proc.c in the Linux kernel
   through 4.8.2, when the GNU Compiler Collection (gcc) stack protector is
   enabled, uses an incorrect buffer size for certain timeout data, which
   allows local users to cause a denial of service (stack memory corruption
   and panic) by reading the /proc/keys file. (CVE-2016-7042)
 * The arcmsr_iop_message_xfer function in drivers/scsi/arcmsr/arcmsr_hba.c in
   the Linux kernel through 4.8.2 does not restrict a certain length field,
   which allows local users to gain privileges or cause a denial of service
   (heap-based buffer overflow) via an ARCMSR_MESSAGE_WRITE_WQBUFFER control
   code. (CVE-2016-7425)
 * drivers/firewire/net.c in the Linux kernel before 4.8.7, in certain unusual
   hardware configurations, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code
   via crafted fragmented packets (CVE-2016-8633)
 * The __get_user_asm_ex macro in arch/x86/include/asm/uaccess.h in the Linux
   kernel before 4.7.5 does not initialize a certain integer variable, which
   allows local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel stack memory
   by triggering failure of a get_user_ex call (CVE-2016-9178)
 * af_packet.c race condition (local root) (CVE-2016-8655)
 * The tipc_msg_build function in net/tipc/msg.c in the Linux kernel through
   4.8.11 does not validate the relationship between the minimum fragment
   length and the maximum packet size, which allows local users to gain
   privileges or cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer overflow) by
   leveraging the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability (CVE-2016-8632)
 * fs: Avoid premature clearing of capabilities (CVE-2015-1350)
 * posix_acl: Clear SGID bit when setting file permissions (CVE-2016-7097)
 * mnt: Add a per mount namespace limit on the number of mounts
   (CVE-2016-6213)
 * ptrace: being capable wrt a process requires mapped uids/gids
   (CVE-2015-8709)
 * net: add recursion limit to GRO (CVE-2016-7039)
 * net: ping: check minimum size on ICMP header length (CVE-2016-8399)
 * kvm: nVMX: uncaught software exceptions in L1 guest lead to DoS
   (CVE-2016-9588)
 * Memory corruption in SCSI generic device interface (CVE-2016-10088)
 * crash by spawning mcrypt(alg) with incompatible algorithm (CVE-2016-10147)
 * KVM: x86: fix emulation of "MOV SS, null selector" (CVE-2017-2583)
 * kvm: use after free in complete_emulated_mmio (CVE-2017-2584)
 * The simple-framebuffer has been disabled because it breaks the linux
   console for many DRM drivers.
 * sgid bit not cleared on tmpfs (CVE-2017-5551)
note: This is the third part of the update.
