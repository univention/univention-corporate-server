 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * The UDM module "settings/data" was added. It can be used to store
   arbitrary data in LDAP.
 * The error messages for the join into an Active Directory domain
   have been improved.
 * Check output from slapschema during registration of new schemas for errors.
 * The umc_init function does not assume to find the LDAP group objects
   "cn=Domain Admins" and and "cn=Domain Users" as direct children of
   the "cn=groups" container anymore. Instead it searches for them (or their
   localized equivalents, like "Domänen-Admins").
