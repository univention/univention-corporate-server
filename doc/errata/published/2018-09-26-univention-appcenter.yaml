fix: 7.0.2-31A~4.3.0.201809181530
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * When an app is opened in the App Center, the page now scrolls to the
   top and when the App detail page is closed, the previous scroll position
   is restored.
 * Proxy settings in containers are updated before an app upgrade.
 * Installation routines now ask for valid credentials before actually doing
   anything. This prevents possible errors when reverting the installation.
   status should the credentials be invalid.
 * Never prompt in container commands during the app installation.
