fix: 2:4.1.0-1.694.201410141852
version: [2]
desc: |
  This update fixes the following issues:
  * When installing broken printdrivers, samba returned a wrong error code
    (access denied).  This has been fixed.
  * The main samba (not smbd) processes have been restricted to 1024 open files.
    Now they use the value configured in the UCR variable samba/max_open_files.
  * Fix smbd crash on filenames with non-ascii characters.
  * A bug has been fixed which could prevent a takeover of Windows 2012 servers
    with enabled recycle bin.
