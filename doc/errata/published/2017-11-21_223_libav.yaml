fix: 6:11.11-1~deb8u1
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * The smka_decode_frame function in libavcodec/smacker.c does not verify that
   the data size is consistent with the number of channels, which allows
   remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds array access)
   or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted Smacker data.
   (CVE-2015-8365)
 * Multiple integer overflows have been discovered in libav 11.8 and earlier,
   allowing remote attackers to cause a crash via a crafted MP3 file
   (CVE-2016-9821 CVE-2016-9822)
 * The decode_residual function in libavcodec allows remote attackers to cause
   a denial of service (buffer over-read) or obtain sensitive information from
   process memory via a crafted h264 video file. (CVE-2017-7208)
 * FFmpeg before 2017-02-07 has an out-of-bounds write caused by a heap-based
   buffer overflow related to the decode_frame function in
   libavcodec/pictordec.c. (CVE-2017-7862)
 * Heap-based buffer overflow in the decode_dds1 function in libavcodec/dfa.c
   allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or
   possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted file. (CVE-2017-9992)
