desc: |
    This update fixes the following issues in univention-samba:
    * In Samba 3.6 and older the execution right in the ACL was not checked,
      so a client could execute a file even if it did not have execute rights
      on the file. In Samba 4.0, this has been fixed. To re-establishing the
      old behaviour the new UCR variable samba/acl/allow/execute/always has
      been added (default True).
