fix: 2.8.0+dfsg1-7~ucs3.3.56.201611091327
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * dict.c in libxml2 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
   service (heap-based buffer over-read and application crash) via an
   unexpected character immediately after the "<!DOCTYPE html"
   substring in a crafted HTML document. (CVE-2015-8806)
 * libxml2 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause
   a denial of service (memory corruption) via a crafted XML
   document. (CVE-2016-1762, CVE-2016-1833, CVE-2016-1834, CVE-2016-1835,
   CVE-2016-1837, CVE-2016-1838, CVE-2016-1839, CVE-2016-1840)
 * The htmlParseNameComplex function in HTMLparser.c in libxml2 allows
   attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read) via a
   crafted XML document. (CVE-2016-2073)
 * The xmlStringGetNodeList function in tree.c in libxml2 2.9.3 and
   earlier, when used in recovery mode, allows context-dependent
   attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite recursion, stack
   consumption, and application crash) via a crafted XML
   document. (CVE-2016-3627)
 * The (1) xmlParserEntityCheck and (2) xmlParseAttValueComplex
   functions in parser.c in libxml2 2.9.3 do not properly keep track
   of the recursion depth, which allows context-dependent attackers to
   cause a denial of service (stack consumption and application crash)
   via a crafted XML document containing a large number of nested
   entity references. (CVE-2016-3705)
 * The xmlParseElementDecl function in parser.c in libxml2 before
   2.9.4 allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of
   service (heap-based buffer underread and application crash) via a
   crafted file, involving xmlParseName. (CVE-2016-4447)
 * XML external entity (XXE) vulnerability in the
   xmlStringLenDecodeEntities function in parser.c in libxml2 before
   2.9.4, when not in validating mode, allows context-dependent
   attackers to read arbitrary files or cause a denial of service
   (resource consumption) via unspecified vectors. (CVE-2016-4449)
 * When a specially-crafted XML file is parsed via an application compiled
   against libxml2, this can cause the application to crash (no code
   execution, out-of-bounds read). (CVE-2016-4483)
 * libxml2 in Apple iOS before 10, OS X before 10.12, tvOS before 10,
   and watchOS before 3 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary
   code or cause a denial of service (memory corruption) via a crafted
   XML document. (CVE-2016-4658)
 * legacy xmlXPtrRangeToFunction could be abused to trigger
   use-after-free error with the potential for remote code execution
   (CVE-2016-5131)
