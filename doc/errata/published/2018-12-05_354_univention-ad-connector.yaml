fix: 12.0.0-41A~4.3.0.201811281509
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * The synchronization of password hashes from AD to UCS has been fixed
   on systems that have UCR connector/ldap/server set to a non-master server
   with read-only OpenLDAP.
 * Fix kerberos authentication error during AD-Connector restart in ad/member
   mode in case of changed system time.
 * The error messages for the join into an Active Directory domain
   have been improved.
 * Fix AD to UCS password hash synchronization in cases where a custom
   Domain Admin account is configured for the AD connection.
 * The synchronization of the proxyAddress attribute may fail if is empty.
   This issue has been fixed.
 * The special cn=Subschema object caused AD-Connector rejects
 * Base64 encode non-printable attributes in univention-adsearch
 * Space separated attribute list as parameter in univention-adsearch
 * The Connector now updates the AD attribute userPrincipalName if the
   UCS username is changed (disabled for all updated systems, unset
   UCR variable connector/ad/mapping/sync/userPrincipalName and restart
   the AD-Connctor to sync username to userPrincipalName on subsequent
   object modifications)
