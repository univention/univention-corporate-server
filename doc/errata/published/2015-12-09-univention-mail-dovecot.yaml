version: [0]
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * An error in the dovecot listener could lead to the unintended
   deletion of a shared folder if the corresponding LDAP objects is changed
   (Bug #40014).
 * The UMC permissions "write" and "all" for shared folders did not
   contain the IMAP permission for expunge. A removal of mails or moving
   mails was not possible. This problem has been fixed and the permission
   will be updated automatically if the join script of
   univention-mail-dovecot is called.
