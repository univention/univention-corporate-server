desc: |-
  This update addresses the following issue(s):
  * The email field in the Contacts tab of a user no longer has its value
    prefilled with the value of the mailPrimaryAddress field. As the prefilled
    value was not saved to LDAP, this led to undesired inconsistencies in the
    display of the actual data.
  * DNS entries on Computers are no longer allowed to have an empty forward or
    reverse zone. Setting it empty led to tracebacks.
  * The App opsi does add system users during the installation. These do not
    count against the license anymore.
  * Every installation of a Docker Apps adds one machine account. These do not
    count against the license anymore.
