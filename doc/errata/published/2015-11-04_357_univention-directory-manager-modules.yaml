 This update addresses the following issues:
 * It is not possible to create a user with a user id which exists as group
   id (and vice versa) anymore.
 * DNS TXT records are now shown via the DNS UMC module.
 * In some cases the automatic update of the attribute "displayName" caused
   tracebacks in S4 connector. The UDM module users/user has been updated to
   fix this traceback.
