fix: 6.0.11-15.645.201603161129
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * The PTR-Record entries are now sorted numerical in the overview of a
   reverse zone.
 * The DNS module now displays more information in the grid columns and
   forward zones are now shown before reverse zones in the tree view.
 * Searching for a specific object type underneath of cn=univention in the
   LDAP directory did not yield results and has been repaired.
 * Searching for properties which require an exact match did not work because
   the LDAP filter was prepended with "*". The search for e.g. the gidNumber
   of a group is now possible again.
 * Searching for properties using the LDAPSearch syntax class caused a
   traceback.
 * The users/self module can now be activated again via setting the UCR
   variable "umc/module/udm/users/self/disabled" to "false".
