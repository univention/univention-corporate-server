fix: 10.0.4-4.629.201612131743
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * The init-script has been fixed to check for an already running instance of
   the S4 connector. The PID file is removed on shutdown. The 'status' action
   has been added, too.
 * When adjusting a GPO security filter via Group Policy Management Console
   repeatedly in a short time, the S4-Connector could revert changes,
   depending on timing. Now the S4-Connector checks if a change has happened
   in Samba/AD since the last sync and avoids overwriting the attribute
   nTSecurityDescriptor in that case.
 * The synchronization of DNS zones now also works in special setups, where
   samba4/ldap/base differs from ldap/base.
