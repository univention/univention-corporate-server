 This update addresses the following issues:
 * Use-after-free vulnerability in the matroska_read_seek function
   (CVE-2014-7933)
 * Memory corruption in MJPEG (CVE-2014-8541)
 * Invalid memory access in MMVideo (CVE-2014-8543)
 * Invalid memory access in TIFF (CVE-2014-8544)
 * Invalid memory access in PNG (CVE-2014-8545)
 * Integer underflow in Cinepak (CVE-2014-8546)
 * Out of bounds access in GIF (CVE-2014-8547)
 * Off-by-one in the SMC (CVE-2014-8548)
 * Memory corruption in he VMD decoder (CVE-2014-9603)
 * Denial of service in the Ut Video decoder (CVE-2014-9604)
 * The seg_write_packet function in libavformat/segment.c does not free the
   correct memory location, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
   service ("invalid memory handler") and possibly execute arbitrary code via
   a crafted video that triggers a use after free. (CVE-2014-9676)
 * The ff_mjpeg_decode_sof function in libavcodec/mjpegdec.c does not validate
   the number of components in a JPEG-LS Start Of Frame segment, which allows
   remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds array access)
   or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted Motion JPEG data
   (CVE-2015-1872)
 * The ff_h263_decode_mba function in libavcodec/ituh263dec.c allows remote
   attackers to cause a denial of service (divide-by-zero error and
   application crash) via a file with crafted dimensions (CVE-2015-5479)
 * The smka_decode_frame function in libavcodec/smacker.c does not verify that
   the data size is consistent with the number of channels, which allows
   remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds array access)
   or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted Smacker data.
   (CVE-2015-8365)
 * remote cross-origin attacks and read arbitrary files by using the concat
   protocol in an HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) M3U8 file, leading to an external
   HTTP request in which the URL string contains the first line of a local
   file. (CVE-2016-1897)
 * remote cross-origin attacks and read arbitrary files by using the subfile
   protocol in an HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) M3U8 file, leading to an external
   HTTP request in which the URL string contains an arbitrary line of a local
   file. (CVE-2016-1898)
 * Integer overflow in the asf_write_packet function in libavformat/asfenc.c
   allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have
   unspecified other impact via a crafted PTS (aka presentation timestamp)
   value in a .mov file. (CVE-2016-2326)
 * memory corruption when parsing .mp4 files possibly leading to crash or
   arbitrary code execution (CVE-2016-3062)
 * The aac_sync function in libavcodec/aac_parser.c is vulnerable to a
   stack-based buffer overflow (CVE-2016-7393)
 * The put_no_rnd_pixels8_xy2_mmx function in x86/rnd_template.c allows remote
   attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and crash)
   via a crafted MP3 file (CVE-2016-7424)
 * The h264 codec is vulnerable to various crashes with invalid-free,
   corrupted double-linked list or out-of-bounds read (No CVE assigned)
 * Multiple integer overflows have been discovered, allowing remote attackers
   to cause a crash via a crafted MP3 file (CVE-2016-9819 CVE-2016-9820
   CVE-2016-9821 CVE-2016-9822)
 * The decode_residual function in libavcodec allows remote attackers to cause
   a denial of service (buffer over-read) or obtain sensitive information from
   process memory via a crafted h264 video file. (CVE-2017-7208)
 * Out-of-bounds write caused by a heap-based buffer overflow related to the
   decode_frame function in libavcodec/pictordec.c. (CVE-2017-7862)
 * Heap-based buffer overflow in the decode_dds1 function in libavcodec/dfa.c
   allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or
   possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted file. (CVE-2017-9992)
