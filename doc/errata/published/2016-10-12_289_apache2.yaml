desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue:
 * The Apache HTTPD server used the value of the Proxy header from HTTP
   requests to initialize the HTTP_PROXY environment variable for CGI scripts,
   which in turn was incorrectly used by certain HTTP client implementations
   to configure the proxy for outgoing HTTP requests. A remote attacker could
   possibly use this flaw to redirect HTTP requests performed by a CGI script
   to an attacker-controlled proxy via a malicious HTTP request.
