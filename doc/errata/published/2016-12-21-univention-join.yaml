 This update addresses the following issues:
 * The root SSL certificate used for the UCS domain is now registered as a
   trusted root certificate for all applications using /etc/ssl/certs/.
 * Joining a UCS system into a domain now works for hostnames, where the
   corresponding host LDAP entry was created using a different casing.
