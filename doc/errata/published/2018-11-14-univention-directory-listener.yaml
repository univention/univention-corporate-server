desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue:
 * The Listener opens two connections: a persistent connection to a Notifier
   and an on-demand connection to an LDAP server. In some rare situations two
   different hosts were contacted for those connections, which could lead to
   inconsistencies in LDAP replication.
