desc: |
  This update addresses the following issues:
  * When a domain controller (DC) master or DC backup is created, two
    policies are now created or modified: a LDAP server policy to be used
    by member servers and a UCR policy be used by DC slaves.
    The policies configure them to use the LDAP servers of all available
    DC backups, in case the DC master is down. The LDAP server policy is
    activated on members, the UCR policy for slaves is not activated by
    default.
  * Added printerModel to LDAP sub-string search index.
  * The script '/usr/share/univention-ldap/ldap_setup_index' has been
    extracted. It can be used to manage the attributes, which are indexed by
    the LDAP server.
  * Some shell quoting errors were fixed.
  * Only initialize the LDAP server on the DC Master and abort on errors.
  * The attribute "univentionMessageCatalog" has been added to the LDAP schema
    for the univentionUDMHook and univentionUDMSyntax object classes.
