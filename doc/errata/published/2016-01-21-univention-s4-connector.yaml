 This update addresses the following issue:
 * Erratum 39 accidentally set connector/s4/listener/disabled=true on
   UCS Samba/AD DCs which run an S4 Connector in an UCS domain where
   multiple S4 Connector services are registered in LDAP. This may
   affect a DC Master in an UCS@school environment. This doesn't
   affect UCS Samba/AD DCs where connector/s4/allow/secondary is true,
   which comprises UCS@school Samba AD DC Slave systems.
