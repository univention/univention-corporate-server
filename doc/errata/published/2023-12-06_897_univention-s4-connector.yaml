fix: 14.0.15-6
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * Starting with UCS 5.0 the S4-Connector converted Posix-only groups
   to Samba groups. This was a regression compared to the behavior
   in UCS 4.4. Now the mapping offers a new key `auto_enable_udm_option`
   that is disabled by default and is only activated for the UDM property
   `userCertificate`, allowing changes of UDM object options just in that
   special case.
