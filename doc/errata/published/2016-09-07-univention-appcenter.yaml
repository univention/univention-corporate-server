desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * The App Center can now create a database for an App if it wishes so. Useful
   for Docker Apps as the database is created outside the container.
 * Fixed web interface links for Docker Apps without automatic Apache
   integration.
 * If needed, Docker Apps may now get read-only access to the Host's
   certificate
 * Some typos have been corrected.
