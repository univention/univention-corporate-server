fix: 10.0.0-15.172.201606271746
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * 'univention-certificate check' now also checks the expiry date of the
   certificate.
 * 'univention-certificate new' now also accepts the '-days' parameter.
 * 'univention-certificate' now checks the UCS server role, as its full
   functionality is only available on the 'DC Master'.
 * Changing the UCRVs 'ssl/default/hashfunction' and 'ssl/default/bits' now
   takes immediate effect.
 * During the initial CA creation '2.debian.pool.ntp.org' is used in addition,
   which also contains IPv6 capable time servers.
 * The certificate revocation list in now updated periodically. The intervals
   are configured through the UCRV 'ssl/crl/interval' and 'ssl/crl/validity'.
 * The SSL extension example was fixed to work with with non-bash-shells.
 * Locking was added to prevent parallel execution when managing certificates.
 * Server certificates are no longer revoked and re-created when the LDAP host
   entry is only moved.
 * The new UCRV 'ssl/ca/cipher' can be used to chose the encryption mechanism
   for the private key of the root CA. The new default is aes256.
 * The new UCRV 'ssl/host/objectclass' can be used to configure the LDAP
   object classes for which SSL certificates are automatically created.
