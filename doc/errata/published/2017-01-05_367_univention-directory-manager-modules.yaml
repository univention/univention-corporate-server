fix: 11.0.3-53.1448.201701031145
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * Searching with an empty value for properties which weren't registered in
   any mapping lead to broken search filters.
 * Allow setting of RID to make the S4 connector able to sync the SID
   correctly.
 * The syntax check for DNS SOA/NS/PTR records has been improved. Host and
   domain names according to RFC1123 are now accepted.
 * DNS NS records now only accept fully qualified host names.
 * When a group which is member of another group is renamed, the old
   group DN could be left over in the containing group if the spelling
   case found in the 'uniqueMember' attribute differed from the
   spelling case of the actual group name. This can happen in
   combination with both AD-Connector and S4-Connector. Now the update
   of the 'uniqueMember' attribute is performed in a case insensitive
   way.
 * When adding or removing group memberships the values are now compared with
   respect to the syntax of DN's.
