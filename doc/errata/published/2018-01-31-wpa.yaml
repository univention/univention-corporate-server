 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA and WPA2) that supports IEEE 802.11r allows
   reinstallation of the Pairwise Transient Key (PTK) Temporal Key (TK) during
   the fast BSS transmission (FT) handshake, allowing an attacker within radio
   range to replay, decrypt, or spoof frames. (CVE-2017-13082)
 * Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA and WPA2) allows reinstallation of the Group
   Temporal Key (GTK) during the group key handshake, allowing an attacker
   within radio range to replay frames from access points to clients.
   (CVE-2017-13080)
 * Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA and WPA2) that supports IEEE 802.11w allows
   reinstallation of the Integrity Group Temporal Key (IGTK) during the group
   key handshake, allowing an attacker within radio range to spoof frames from
   access points to clients. (CVE-2017-13081)
 * Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA and WPA2) allows reinstallation of the Tunneled
   Direct-Link Setup (TDLS) Peer Key (TPK) during the TDLS handshake, allowing
   an attacker within radio range to replay, decrypt, or spoof frames.
   (CVE-2017-13086)
 * Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA and WPA2) that support 802.11v allows
   reinstallation of the Group Temporal Key (GTK) when processing a Wireless
   Network Management (WNM) Sleep Mode Response frame, allowing an attacker
   within radio range to replay frames from access points to clients.
   (CVE-2017-13087)
 * Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA and WPA2) that support 802.11v allows
   reinstallation of the Integrity Group Temporal Key (IGTK) when processing a
   Wireless Network Management (WNM) Sleep Mode Response frame, allowing an
   attacker within radio range to replay frames from access points to clients.
   (CVE-2017-13088)
 * Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA and WPA2) that supports IEEE 802.11w allows
   reinstallation of the Integrity Group Temporal Key (IGTK) during the
   four-way handshake, allowing an attacker within radio range to spoof frames
   from access points to clients. (CVE-2017-13079)
 * Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA and WPA2) allows reinstallation of the Group
   Temporal Key (GTK) during the four-way handshake, allowing an attacker
   within radio range to replay frames from access points to clients.
   (CVE-2017-13078)
 * Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA and WPA2) allows reinstallation of the Pairwise
   Transient Key (PTK) Temporal Key (TK) during the four-way handshake,
   allowing an attacker within radio range to replay, decrypt, or spoof
   frames. (CVE-2017-13077)
