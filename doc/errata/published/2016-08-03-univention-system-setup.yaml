   fast instantiation for demo purposes. Some more aspects of the setup
   process have been improved w.r.t. reliability and speed.
 * Some more corrections have been applied for the fast UCS instantiation.
 * A UCR variable for enabling/disabling the fast instantiation has been
   added.
 * Problems with a hanging setup process when finishing have been
   corrected.
 * The timeout for internal LDAP queries during changes of network
   configurations has been adjusted for the UCS setup process.
 * The rendering of the welcome screen after booting a UCS system has been
   improved and overlaying log messages have been removed.
 * Problems with a disabled repository after setup have been corrected.
 * An error dialog has been corrected which eventually showed up during
   the setup process stating that no module would be available.
 * A typo in the header for the initial setup of UCS on an
   Amazon EC2 instance has been corrected.
 * Enable collection of usage data during the system setup to allow future
   improvements to the user experience.
 * Regenerate the system UUID during the fast setup demo mode to ensure a
   unique system.
 * Errors that occur during the system setup of UCS can now be sent as
   feedback to Univention by the user.
 * Redirection problems for app appliances at the end of the setup wizard
   have been corrected.
