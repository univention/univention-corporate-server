desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * A locking mechanism for ldap-group-to-file.py has been implemented
   so that it is ensured the process only runs once at a time.
 * Disable PAM module 'systemd' by default. It can be re-enabled by setting
   the UCR variable `pam/session/systemd` to `true`.
