desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * The GIF decoding function gdImageCreateFromGifCtx does not zero colorMap
   arrays before use. A specially crafted GIF image could use the
   uninitialized tables to read ~700 bytes from the top of the stack,
   potentially disclosing sensitive information. (CVE-2017-7890)
 * Double free vulnerability in the gdImagePngPtr function allows remote
   attackers to cause a denial of service via vectors related to a palette
   with no colors. (CVE-2017-6362)
