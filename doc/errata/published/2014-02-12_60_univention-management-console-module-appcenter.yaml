  This errata update fixes several issues:
  * Support to declare "end of life" for an application: An application marked as
    such is hidden for new users. For those who have this application installed
    uninstallation is suggested.
  * Applications extending the LDAP schema added repositories on DC master and
    DC backup systems to install the corresponding software package. This might
    cause problems when upgrading UCS as these repositories were never removed
    automatically. This will be done from now on. "Stale" repositories already
    registered are also removed.
  * When doing an update of an application a hint is shown saying that all
    packages will be upgraded. If this is not intended one would have to go to
    the repository settings tab. This tab is not present when updating the
    application via its dedicated UMC module. Now the text contains a link and
    it opens the App Center if it was not already open and switches to the
    repository tab.
  * When querying during a release update of UCS, the target version should be
    used to find all applications. This is done by reading from the
    updater.status file.
