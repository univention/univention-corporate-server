 This update addresses the following issues:
 * The dependency on `py3dns` has been replaced by `dnspython` to support
   EDNS, which is required for virtual machines on AWS-EC2 and OpenStack.
 * The StartTLS operation mode is now configurable via the UCR variable
   `directory/manager/starttls`. This is required in a Kubernetes environment.
