  This errata update fixes several bugs in the package univention-samba4:
  * During reinstallations of previously joined Samba 4 DCs
    the 98univention-samba4-dns join script could abort due
    to an objectSid conflict. If a Samba 4 DC needs to be
    reinstalled this errata needs to be installed first and
    the sam.ldb in the directory /var/lib/samba/private on that DC
    must not contain any data yet. This condition may be fulfilled
    by moving the directory out of the way on that DC before initiating
    the domain join.
  * The join script now also removes leftover Samba 4 DNS
    alias records pointing to the FQDN of the joining DC.
  * During the join of a Samba 4 DC with samba4/role=RODC
    the 98univention-samba4-dns join script failed.
  * The samba3 to samba4 migration could fail parsing
    long LDAP DNs.
  * The ntp server did not have access to /var/lib/samba/ntp_signd
  * The Samba 4 nbt_server was started even though the
    UCR variable samba4/service/nmb was set to nmbd.
  * Misnamed UCR variable samba4/service/nbtd.
  * Missing default for samba/debug/level in smb.conf template
  * Netlogon path adjustable via samba/share/netlogon/path
