fix: 4.1.3-21.52.201509171449
version: [6,7]
desc: |
 The following security vulnerabilities have been fixed in xen-4.1:
 * x86/mm: Fix loop increment in paging_log_dirty_range() (CVE-2012-5511)
   fix was incomplete
 * tools: xenstored: if the reply is too big then send E2BIG error
   (CVE-2013-4416)
 * x86/HVM: only allow ring 0 guest code to make hypercalls (CVE-2013-4554)
 * x86/AMD: work around erratum 793 (CVE-2013-6885)
 * VMX: fix cr0.cd handling (CVE-2013-2212)
 * PHYSDEVOP_{prepare,release}_msix exposed to unprivileged guests
   (CVE-2014-1666)
 * Denial of service against host by malicious HVM guest with assigned PCI
   device with pass-through (Long latency MMIO mapping operations are not
   preemptible) (CVE-2015-2752)
 * HVM qemu unexpectedly enabling emulated VGA graphics backends
   (CVE-2015-2152)
 * Information leak through XEN_DOMCTL_gettscinfo (CVE-2015-3340)
 * Denial of service (host interrupt handling confusion) due to potential
   unintended writes to host MSI message data field via qemu by untrusted
   guest administrators (CVE-2015-4103)
 * Denial of service (unexpected interrupt and host crash) due to PCI MSI mask
   bits inadvertently exposed to guests (CVE-2015-4104)
 * Denial of service due to guest triggerable qemu MSI-X pass-through error
   messages filling up the host storage (CVE-2015-4105)
 * Unmediated PCI command register access in qemu (CVE-2015-2756)
 * Unmediated PCI register access in qemu possibly allows privilege
   escalation, host crash (Denial of Service), and leaked information
   (CVE-2015-4106)
 * A privileged guest user in a guest with an AMD PCNet ethernet card enabled
   can potentially use this flaw to execute arbitrary code on the host with
   the privileges of the hosting QEMU process (CVE-2015-3209)
 * The compat_iret function in Xen 3.1 through 4.5 iterates the wrong way
   through a loop, which allows local 32-bit PV guest administrators to
   cause a denial of service (large loop and system hang) via a hypercall_iret
   call with EFLAGS.VM set (CVE-2015-4164)
 * xl command line config handling stack overflow (CVE-2015-3259)
 * QEMU heap overflow flaw while processing certain ATAPI commands
   (CVE-2015-5154)
 * QEMU leak of uninitialized heap memory in rtl8139 device model
   (CVE-2015-5165)
 In addition the use of va_end() after va_copy() has been fixed.
