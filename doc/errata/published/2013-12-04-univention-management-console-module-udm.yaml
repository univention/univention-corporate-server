  This errata update fixes several issues:
  * Boolean attributes of policies are rendered as CheckBoxes. If these
    attributes were not defined, the CheckBox was shown as ticked. This has
    been changed to unticked.
  * If the initial search attribute for a UDM module is configured and its
    value was not any searchable attribute, it caused LDAP errors. Now the
    module falls back to search for "Default properties".
