fix: 6.0.10-33A~4.2.0.201709131219
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * Improve cleanup of old backups in univention-samba4-backup.
 * Run samba-tool dbcheck --cross-ncs --fix --yes on update if there are
   inconsistencies. A backup of /var/lib/samba/private is performed and
   the fix is skipped if the available disk space is too low.
 * Create Windows 10 default profile (default.V6) in univention-skel.
 * Abort samba provision during join if dead links in sysvol.
 * The listener module for samba shares now correctly encodes filenames. Share
   names containing special characters caused errors.
 * Fixed samba drivers permission in join script and postinst.
