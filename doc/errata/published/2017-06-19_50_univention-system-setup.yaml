   while preparing an appliance.
 * A cleanup script used in Univention App Appliances has
   been adapted for UCS 4.2.
 * IP address changes are now also applied to portal entries.
 * When selecting fast demo mode in an App Appliance, all IP
   addresses in LDAP are reconfigured to the correct address.
 * The overview of changed network settings doesn't show HTML code anymore.
 * The decision between joining systems into UCS or Active Directory domains
   was confusing and has been improved.
 * A crash is prevented when trying to join into an active directory domain
   and the active directory server is not reachable.
 * A crash is prevented in appliance scenarios if no domain name was entered.
