fix: 12.0.17-21A~4.2.0.201706271359
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * Group and user objects can now be copied in UMC.
 * The <:umlauts> modifier in the templating mechanism of e.g. user
   templates now normalizes all characters.
 * When creating policy objects the DN of the created object is returned.
 * The LDAP base could not be modified via UMC anymore since erratum 39.
   This has been fixed.
 * An error in the UDM python interface has been fixed which caused that
   default values containing template variables (e.g. the mail property
   of a user) were not reset resulting in wrong default values if multiple
   objects were created at once.
