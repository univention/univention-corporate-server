fix: 3.1.1-3.7.201608291255
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * Denial of service in internal/XMLReader.cpp via crafted XML data
   (CVE-2015-0252)
 * Apache Xerces-C XML Parser Crashes on Malformed Input
   (CVE-2016-0729)
 * Use-after-free vulnerability in validators/DTD/DTDScanner.cpp in
   Apache Xerces C++ 3.1.3 and earlier does not properly handle
   exceptions raised in the XMLReader class, which allows
   context-dependent attackers to have unspecified impact via an
   invalid character in an XML document. (CVE-2016-2099)
 * Brandon Perry discovered that xerces-c, a validating XML parser
   library for C++, fails to successfully parse a DTD that is deeply
   nested, causing a stack overflow. A remote unauthenticated attacker
   can take advantage of this flaw to cause a denial of service
   against applications using the xerces-c library. (CVE-2016-4463)
 * Additionally this update includes an enhancement to enable
   applications to fully disable DTD processing through the use of an
   environment variable (XERCES_DISABLE_DTD).
