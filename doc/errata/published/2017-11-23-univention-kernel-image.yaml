 This update of the Linux kernel to version 4.9.64 addresses the following
 issues:
 * [x86] drm/vmwgfx: limit the number of mip levels in
   vmw_gb_surface_define_ioctl() (CVE-2017-7346)
 * rxrpc: Fix several cases where a padded len isn't checked in ticket decode
   (CVE-2017-7482)
 * brcmfmac: fix possible buffer overflow in brcmf_cfg80211_mgmt_tx()
   (CVE-2017-7541)
 * ipv6: avoid overflow of offset in ip6_find_1stfragopt (CVE-2017-7542)
 * [x86] drm/vmwgfx: Make sure backup_handle is always valid (CVE-2017-9605)
 * drm/virtio: don't leak bo on drm_gem_object_init failure (CVE-2017-10810)
 * xen-blkback: don't leak stack data via response ring (CVE-2017-10911)
 * mqueue: fix a use-after-free in sys_mq_notify() (CVE-2017-11176)
 * fs/exec.c: account for argv/envp pointers (CVE-2017-1000365)
 * dentry name snapshots (CVE-2017-7533)
 * fs/namespace.c does not restrict how many mounts may exist in a mount
   namespace, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (memory
   consumption and deadlock) via MS_BIND mount system calls. (CVE-2016-6213)
 * The filesystem implementation preserves the setgid bit during a setxattr
   call, which allows local users to gain group privileges by leveraging the
   existence of a setgid program with restrictions on execute permissions.
   (CVE-2016-7097)
 * An information disclosure vulnerability in kernel components including the
   ION subsystem, Binder, USB driver and networking subsystem could enable a
   local malicious application to access data outside of its permission
   levels. This issue is rated as Moderate because it first requires
   compromising a privileged process. (CVE-2016-8405)
 * The cgroup offline implementation mishandles certain drain operations,
   which allows local users to cause a denial of service (system hang) by
   leveraging access to a container environment for executing a crafted
   application. (CVE-2016-9191)
 * The load_segment_descriptor implementation in arch/x86/kvm/emulate.c
   improperly emulates a "MOV SS, NULL selector" instruction, which allows
   guest OS users to cause a denial of service (guest OS crash) or gain guest
   OS privileges via a crafted application. (CVE-2017-2583)
 * arch/x86/kvm/emulate.c allows local users to obtain sensitive information
   from kernel memory or cause a denial of service (use-after-free) via a
   crafted application that leverages instruction emulation for fxrstor,
   fxsave, sgdt, and sidt. (CVE-2017-2584)
 * The keyring_search_aux function in security/keys/keyring.c allows local
   users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and OOPS) via
   a request_key system call for the "dead" type. (CVE-2017-6951)
 * The xfrm_replay_verify_len function in net/xfrm/xfrm_user.c does not
   validate certain size data after an XFRM_MSG_NEWAE update, which allows
   local users to obtain root privileges or cause a denial of service
   (heap-based out-of-bounds access) by leveraging the CAP_NET_ADMIN
   capability. (CVE-2017-7184)
 * The KEYS subsystem allows local users to cause a denial of service (memory
   consumption) via a series of KEY_REQKEY_DEFL_THREAD_KEYRING
   keyctl_set_reqkey_keyring calls. (CVE-2017-7472)
 * The saa7164_bus_get function in drivers/media/pci/saa7164/saa7164-bus.c
   allows local users to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds array
   access) or possibly have unspecified other impact by changing a certain
   sequence-number value, aka a "double fetch" vulnerability. (CVE-2017-8831)
 * The sanity_check_ckpt function in fs/f2fs/super.c does not validate the
   blkoff and segno arrays, which allows local users to gain privileges via
   unspecified vectors. (CVE-2017-10663)
 * Buffer overflow in the mp_override_legacy_irq() function in
   arch/x86/kernel/acpi/boot.c allows local users to gain privileges via a
   crafted ACPI table. (CVE-2017-11473)
 * net/xfrm/xfrm_policy.c, when CONFIG_XFRM_MIGRATE is enabled, does not
   ensure that the dir value of xfrm_userpolicy_id is XFRM_POLICY_MAX or less,
   which allows local users to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds
   access) or possibly have unspecified other impact via an XFRM_MSG_MIGRATE
   xfrm Netlink message. (CVE-2017-11600)
 * In /drivers/isdn/i4l/isdn_net.c: A user-controlled buffer is copied into a
   local buffer of constant size using strcpy without a length check which can
   cause a buffer overflow. (CVE-2017-12762)
 * An issue was discovered in the size of the stack guard page on Linux,
   specifically a 4k stack guard page is not sufficiently large and can be
   "jumped" over (the stack guard page is bypassed). (CVE-2017-1000364)
 * The offset2lib patch contains a vulnerability that allows a PIE binary to
   be execve()'ed with 1GB of arguments or environmental strings then the
   stack occupies the address 0x80000000 and the PIE binary is mapped above
   0x40000000 nullifying the protection of the offset2lib patch. This is a
   different issue than CVE-2017-1000371. This issue appears to be limited to
   i386 based systems. (CVE-2017-1000370)
 * The offset2lib patch contains a vulnerability, if RLIMIT_STACK is set to
   RLIM_INFINITY and 1 Gigabyte of memory is allocated (the maximum under the
   1/4 restriction) then the stack will be grown down to 0x80000000, and as
   the PIE binary is mapped above 0x80000000 the minimum distance between the
   end of the PIE binary's read-write segment and the start of the stack
   becomes small enough that the stack guard page can be jumped over by an
   attacker. This is a different issue than CVE-2017-1000370 and
   CVE-2017-1000365. This issue appears to be limited to i386 based systems.
   (CVE-2017-1000371)
 * A kernel data leak due to an out-of-bound read was found in the Linux
   kernel in inet_diag_msg_sctp{,l}addr_fill() and sctp_get_sctp_info()
   functions present since version 4.7-rc1 through version 4.13. A data leak
   happens when these functions fill in sockaddr data structures used to
   export socket's diagnostic information. As a result, up to 100 bytes of the
   slab data could be leaked to a userspace. (CVE-2017-7558)
 * A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's handling of clearing SELinux
   attributes on /proc/pid/attr files. An empty (null) write to this file can
   crash the system by causing the system to attempt to access unmapped kernel
   memory. (CVE-2017-2618)
 * A race condition issue leading to a use-after-free flaw was found in the
   way the raw packet sockets are implemented in the Linux kernel networking
   subsystem handling synchronization. A local user able to open a raw packet
   socket (requires the CAP_NET_RAW capability) could use this flaw to elevate
   their privileges on the system. (CVE-2017-1000111)
 * Exploitable memory corruption due to UFO (UDP fragment offload) to non-UFO
   path switch (CVE-2017-1000112)
 * A security flaw was discovered in the nl80211_set_rekey_data() function in
   net/wireless/nl80211.c. This function does not check whether the required
   attributes are present in a Netlink request. This request can be issued by
   a user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability and may result in a NULL pointer
   dereference and system crash. (CVE-2017-12153)
 * The prepare_vmcs02 function in arch/x86/kvm/vmx.c does not ensure that the
   "CR8-load exiting" and "CR8-store exiting" L0 vmcs02 controls exist in
   cases where L1 omits the "use TPR shadow" vmcs12 control, which allows KVM
   L2 guest OS users to obtain read and write access to the hardware CR8
   register. (CVE-2017-12154)
 * The atyfb_ioctl function in drivers/video/fbdev/aty/atyfb_base.c does not
   initialize a certain data structure, which allows local users to obtain
   sensitive information from kernel stack memory by reading locations
   associated with padding bytes. (CVE-2017-14156)
 * The iscsi_if_rx function in drivers/scsi/scsi_transport_iscsi.c allows
   local users to cause a denial of service (panic) by leveraging incorrect
   length validation. (CVE-2017-14489)
 * The sg_ioctl function in drivers/scsi/sg.c allows local users to obtain
   sensitive information from uninitialized kernel heap-memory locations via
   an SG_GET_REQUEST_TABLE ioctl call for /dev/sg0. (CVE-2017-14991)
 * The KVM subsystem allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service
   (assertion failure, and hypervisor hang or crash) via an out-of bounds
   guest_irq value, related to arch/x86/kvm/vmx.c and virt/kvm/eventfd.c.
   (CVE-2017-1000252)
 * arch/x86/kvm/mmu.c when nested virtualisation is used, does not properly
   traverse guest pagetable entries to resolve a guest virtual address, which
   allows L1 guest OS users to execute arbitrary code on the host OS or cause
   a denial of service (incorrect index during page walking, and host OS
   crash), aka an "MMU potential stack buffer overrun." (CVE-2017-12188)
 * The keyctl_read_key function in security/keys/keyctl.c in the Key
   Management subcomponent. (CVE-2017-12192)
 * A elevation of privilege vulnerability in the Broadcom wi-fi driver.
   (CVE-2017-0786)
 * KVM: x86: fix singlestepping over syscall (CVE-2017-7518)
 * [PowerPC]: Arbitrary stack overwrite causing oops via crafted signal frame
   (CVE-2017-1000255)
 * Race condition in the ALSA subsystem allows local users to cause a denial
   of service (use-after-free) or possibly have unspecified other impact via
   crafted /dev/snd/seq ioctl calls, related to sound/core/seq/seq_clientmgr.c
   and sound/core/seq/seq_ports.c. (CVE-2017-15265)
 * A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's implementation of associative arrays
   (CVE-2017-12193)
 * mac80211: reinstallation of the group key in the Group Key handshake
   (CVE-2017-13080)
 * ALSA: seq: Cancel pending autoload work at unbinding device
   (CVE-2017-16528)
 * usb: usbtest: fix NULL pointer dereference (CVE-2017-16532)
 * Input: ims-psu - check if CDC union descriptor is sane (CVE-2017-16645)
 * media: imon: Fix null-ptr-deref in imon_probe (CVE-2017-16537)
 * media: dib0700: fix invalid dvb_detach argument (CVE-2017-16646)
