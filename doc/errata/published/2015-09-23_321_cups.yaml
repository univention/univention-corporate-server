src: cups
fix: 1.5.3-5.96.201509111033
version: [3]
desc: |
  Multiple security vulnerabilities have been fixed in cups:
  * Integer underflow in the cupsRasterReadPixels function in
    filter/raster.c in CUPS before 2.0.2 allows remote attackers to
    have unspecified impact via a malformed compressed raster file,
    which triggers a buffer overflow (CVE-2014-9679).
  * The add_job function in scheduler/ipp.c in cupsd in CUPS before
    2.0.3 performs incorrect free operations for multiple-value
    job-originating-host-name attributes, which allows remote
    attackers to trigger data corruption for reference-counted strings
    via a crafted (1) IPP_CREATE_JOB or (2) IPP_PRINT_JOB request, as
    demonstrated by replacing the configuration file and consequently
    executing arbitrary code (CVE-2015-1158).
  * Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the cgi_puts function
    in cgi-bin/template.c in the template engine in CUPS before 2.0.3
    allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via
    the QUERY parameter to help/ (CVE-2015-1159).
