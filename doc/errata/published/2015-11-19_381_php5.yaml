fix: 5.3.3.1-7.218.201511161319
version: [7]
desc: |
 This erratum fixes the following issues in php5:
 * Remote Denial of Service and possibly unspecified other impact via a
   crafted tar archive due to heap metadata corruption in the
   phar_parse_metadata function in ext/phar/phar.c (CVE-2015-3307)
 * missing null byte checks for paths in various PHP extensions (CVE-2015-3411
   and CVE-2015-3412)
 * Remote Denial of Service via a crafted entry in a tar archive due to
   integer underflow and memory corruption in the phar_parse_tarfile function
   in ext/phar/tar.c (CVE-2015-4021)
 * Integer overflow in the ftp_genlist() function may result in denial of
   service or potentially the execution of arbitrary code (CVE-2015-4022)
 * Multiple function didn't check for NULL bytes in path names (CVE-2015-4025
   CVE-2015-4026)
 * Arbitrary code execution by providing crafted serialized data with an
   unexpected data type, due to SoapClient::__call method in ext/soap/soap.c
   in PHP before 5.4.39 not verifying that __default_headers is an array
   (CVE-2015-4147)
 * Information disclosure providing crafted serialized data with an int data
   type due to the do_soap_call function in ext/soap/soap.c in PHP before
   5.4.39 not verifying that the uri property is a string (CVE-2015-4148)
 * missing null byte checks for paths in DOM and GD extensions (CVE-2015-4598)
 * Type confusion vulnerability in exception::getTraceAsString in
   unserialize() with various SOAP methods (CVE-2015-4599 CVE-2015-4600
   CVE-2015-4601)
 * Incomplete Class unserialization type confusion (CVE-2015-4602)
 * denial of service when processing a crafted file with Fileinfo
   (CVE-2015-4604 CVE-2015-4605)
 * integer overflow in ftp_genlist() resulting in heap overflow (improved fix
   for CVE-2015-4022) (CVE-2015-4643)
 * NULL pointer dereference in php_pgsql_meta_data() (CVE-2015-4644)
 * Denial of Service due to Segfault in Phar::convertToData on invalid file
   (CVE-2015-5589)
 * Crash or code injection due to Buffer overflow and stack smashing error in
   phar_fix_filepath (CVE-2015-5590)
 * Use after free vulnerability was found in unserialize() function.
   We can create ZVAL and free it via Serializable::unserialize.
   However the unserialize() will still allow to use R: or r: to set
   references to that already freed memory. It is possible to
   use-after-free attack and execute arbitrary code remotely (CVE-2015-6831)
 * Dangling pointer in the unserialization of ArrayObject items
   (CVE-2015-6832)
 * Files extracted from archive may be placed outside of destination
   directory (CVE-2015-6833)
 * Use after free vulnerability was found in unserialize() function.
   We can create ZVAL and free it via Serializable::unserialize.
   However the unserialize() will still allow to use R: or r: to set
   references to that already freed memory. It is possible to
   use-after-free attack and execute arbitrary code remotely (CVE-2015-6834)
 * A type confusion occurs within SOAP serialize_function_call due
   to an insufficient validation of the headers field.
   In the SoapClient's __call method, the verify_soap_headers_array
   check is applied only to headers retrieved from
   zend_parse_parameters; problem is that a few lines later,
   soap_headers could be updated or even replaced with values from
   the __default_headers object fields (CVE-2015-6836).
 * The XSLTProcessor class misses a few checks on the input from the
   libxslt library. The valuePop() function call is able to return
   NULL pointer and php does not check that (CVE-2015-6837)
 * The XSLTProcessor class misses a few checks on the input from the
   libxslt library. The valuePop() function call is able to return
   NULL pointer and php does not check that (CVE-2015-6838)
 * A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way PHP's Phar
   extension parsed Phar archives. A specially crafted archive could
   cause PHP to crash (CVE-2015-7803)
 * An uninitialized pointer use flaw was found in the
   phar_make_dirstream() function of PHP's Phar extension.
   A specially crafted phar file in the ZIP format with a directory
   entry with a file name "/ZIP" could cause a PHP application
   function to crash (CVE-2015-7804)
