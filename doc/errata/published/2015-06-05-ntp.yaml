fix: 1:4.2.6.p5+dfsg-2.43.201506051324
version: [1,2]
desc: |
 These vulnerabilities have been fixed in ntp:
 * Man-in-the-middle attackers may spoof packets by omitting the MAC
   because the symmetric-key feature in the receive function in
   ntp_proto.c requires a correct MAC only if the MAC field has a
   nonzero length (CVE-2015-1798)
 * Man-in-the-middle attackers may cause a denial of service
   (synchronization loss) by spoofing the source IP address of a peer
   because the symmetric-key feature in the receive function in
   ntp_proto.c performs state-variable updates upon receiving certain
   invalid packets (CVE-2015-1799)
