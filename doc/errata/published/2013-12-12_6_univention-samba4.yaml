desc: |
  This errata update fixes several issues:
  * Samba4 could not be started on hosts with only IPv6 interfaces.
    This has been fixed by deactivating WINS support on IPv6 hosts.
  * Multiple logrotate configurations for samba log files could lead
    to warning messages via cron. These redundant configurations are
    removed with this update.
  * ldapsearch-wrapper has been added to univention-ldapsearch calls
    in samba4 related setup scripts to prevent line wrapping of
    search results.
