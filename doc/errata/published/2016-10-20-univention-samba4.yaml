desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * Locking in the sysvol sync script has been improved.
 * In case Samba 4 is installed only on a DC backup the re-join fails. The
   join script now checks if this system is configured as S4 connector
   system and re-initialized the system. In this case all other Samba 4 DCs
   need to be re-joined.
 * The idmap database is now removed while re-joining the system. This
   reduces the re-join time.
 * The following UCR variables have been added to configure the winbind 
   settings: samba/winbind/nested/groups, samba/winbind/rpc/only,
   samba/winbind/max/clients, samba/winbind/enum/users and 
   samba/winbind/enum/groups.
 * It is possible that Samba 4 joins against another DC and not against
   the master. This could led to different problems. The join script
   now tries to join against the S4 Connector system first.
 * The group DC Backup Hosts is now member of the group Enterprise
   Domain Controllers. This is needed for the sysvol replication in
   case Samba 4 is not installed on the DC master.
