desc: |-
  This update addresses the following issue(s):
  * The package now uses dh_python2 instead of python-support.
    Therefore python modules are installed into
    /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/univention/management/console/.
  * The LDAP service is not restarted anymore on every change of the
    univentionService attribute for any computer object in the domain.
  * The development package now uses a file from the translation package
    univention-ucs-translation-template instead of using its own.
