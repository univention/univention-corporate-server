fix: 3.0.50-22.234.201402141113
version: [0]
desc: |
  The join script failed when the App Center server could not be reached while
  registering all installed apps. This causes problems during the installation
  of UCS. Now the join script does not fail anymore, it just silently skips
  this point. The script univention-register-apps has been added that may be
  re-run if this was only a temporary problem.
