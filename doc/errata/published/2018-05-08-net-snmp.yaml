fix: 5.7.2.1+dfsg-1+deb8u1
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * The snmp_pdu_parse function in net-snmp does not remove the varBind
   variable in a netsnmp_variable_list item when parsing of the SNMP PDU
   fails, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash)
   and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted packet. (CVE-2015-5621)
 * NET-SNMP contains a heap corruption vulnerability in the UDP protocol
   handler that can result in command execution. (CVE-2018-1000116)
