 This update addresses the following issues:
 * There is an overflow bug in the AVX2 Montgomery multiplication procedure
   used in exponentiation with 1024-bit moduli. No EC algorithms are affected.
   Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA and DSA as a result of this
   defect would be very difficult to perform and are not believed likely.
   Attacks against DH1024 are considered just feasible, because most of the
   work necessary to deduce information about a private key may be performed
   offline. The amount of resources required for such an attack would be
   significant. However, for an attack on TLS to be meaningful, the server
   would have to share the DH1024 private key among multiple clients, which is
   no longer an option. (CVE-2017-3738)
 * Because of an implementation bug the PA-RISC CRYPTO_memcmp function is
   effectively reduced to only comparing the least significant bit of each
   byte. This allows an attacker to forge messages that would be considered as
   authenticated in an amount of tries lower than that guaranteed by the
   security claims of the scheme. The module can only be compiled by the HP-UX
   assembler, so that only HP-UX PA-RISC targets are affected. (CVE-2018-0733)
 * Constructed ASN.1 types with a recursive definition (such as can be found
   in PKCS7) could eventually exceed the stack given malicious input with
   excessive recursion. This could result in a Denial Of Service attack. There
   are no such structures used within SSL/TLS that come from untrusted sources
   so this is considered safe. (CVE-2018-0739)
