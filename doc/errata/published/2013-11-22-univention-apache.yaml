  This errata update fixes several issues:
  * Entries and available languages on the UCS overview page aren't cached
    anymore.
  * This update corrects the generation of overview links. The links
    are now generated in the join script. This ensures that
    host and domain identifiers match the current settings in case of
    a rejoin and after completing the appliance setup.
