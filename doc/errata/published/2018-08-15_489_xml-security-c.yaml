 This update addresses the following issue:
 * Default KeyInfo resolver doesn't check for empty element content. The
   Apache Santuario XML Security for C++ library contained a number of code
   paths at risk of dereferencing null pointers when processing various kinds
   of malformed KeyInfo hints typically found in signed or encrypted XML. The
   usual effect is a crash, and in the case of the Shibboleth SP software, a
   crash in the shibd daemon.
