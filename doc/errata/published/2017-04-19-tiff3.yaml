 This update addresses the following issues:
 * Applications using libtiff can trigger buffer overflows through
   TIFFGetField() when processing TIFF images with unknown tags
   (CVE-2015-7554, CVE-2016-5318)
 * an out of bounds write in tif_luv.c (CVE-2015-8781)
 * other out-of-bounds writes (CVE-2015-8782)
 * other out-of-bounds reads (CVE-2015-8783)
 * potential out-of-bound write in NeXTDecode (CVE-2015-8784)
 * tif_pixarlog.c has out-of-bounds write vulnerabilities in heap allocated
   buffers (CVE-2016-9533)
 * tif_write.c has an issue in the error code path of TIFFFlushData1() that
   didn't reset the tif_rawcc and tif_rawcp members (CVE-2016-9534)
 * tif_predict.h and tif_predict.c have assertions that can lead to assertion
   failures in debug mode, or buffer overflows in release mode, when dealing
   with unusual tile size like YCbCr with subsampling (CVE-2016-9535)
