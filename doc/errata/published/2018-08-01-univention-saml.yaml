desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * When operating without a separate VirtualHost for single sign-on, a
   rewrite rule in the scope of other config rules limited execution of
   further rewrite rules. This fix restricts the rewrite rule to the
   single sign-on directory.
 * Raw service provider configurations can now be added to udm 
   saml/serviceprovider objects. The configuration will be replicated
   to all domain IdP servers. In addition, the configuration option of
   simplesamlphp LDAP get_attributes is now done in LDAP. The current 
   value set to the UCR variable is migrated to the updated configuration
