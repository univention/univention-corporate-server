desc: |
 This update of the Linux kernel from version 4.1.40 to version 4.9.76
 addresses the following issue:
 * Systems with microprocessors utilizing speculative execution and indirect
   branch prediction may allow unauthorized disclosure of information to an
   attacker with local user access via a side-channel analysis of the data
   cache. (CVE-2017-5754)

 This is a major update for the Linux kernel as Linux kernel version 4.1 is no
 longer maintained and does no longer get any security updates! Backporting
 the patches for 'Meltdown' and 'Spectre' is considered too risky.
 The Linux kernel provides a stable ABI so user programs should not notice the
 upgrade in general. Low-level programs like 'udev' have been updated to
 support both old and new Linux kernels.
 On the other hand kernel internal details have changed, which might break
 external kernel modules.
note: This is the third of five parts.
