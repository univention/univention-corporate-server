desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue:
 * The mount-point option "no_mbcache" was added for ext4 file systems to
   disable the "Filesystem Meta Information Block Cache (mbcache)". The cache
   is used to manage shared Extended Attributes (EAs), which are also used to
   store Access Control Lists (ACLs) for files and directories. For some
   work-loads which use EAs with many different values the cache has
   performance issues and can dead-lock the system in certain cases. Samba is
   one example which uses EAs to store the DOS attributes and NT-ACLs.
   The cache can be disabled by re-mounting the file system using
     mount -o remount,no_mbcache "$fs"
   or by adding the option "no_mbcache" in '/etc/fstab' and rebooting the
   system.
note: This is the 1st part of the update.
