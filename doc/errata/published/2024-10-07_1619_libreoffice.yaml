desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue:
 * Certificate Validation user interface in LibreOffice allows potential
   vulnerability. Signed macros are scripts that have been digitally signed
   by the developer using a cryptographic signature. When a document with a
   signed macro is opened a warning is displayed by LibreOffice before the
   macro is executed. Previously if verification failed the user could fail
   to understand the failure and choose to enable the macros anyway.
