  This errata update fixes several issues:
  * Added a function to query applications based on their component_id.
  * Fixed sending notifications to Univention although the app did not require
    it.
  * When updating from UCS 3.1, apps from UCS 3.1 were registered by mistake.
    Fixed that.
  * The joinscript now fails when registering the apps did not succeed.
  * Show an error message when application registration fails after
    installation. Register applications upon each opening of the module.
