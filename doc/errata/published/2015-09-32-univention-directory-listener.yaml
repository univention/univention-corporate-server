version: [3]
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * LDAP and Univention Directory Notifier connections now use the TCP
   keep-alive mechanism and timeouts consistently to detect stuck
   connections.
 * A filter mechanism was added to the Univention Directory Listener to
   prevent certain objects from being stored to the local cache.
