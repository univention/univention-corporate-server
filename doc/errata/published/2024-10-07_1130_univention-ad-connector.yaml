 This update addresses the following issues:
 * Starting with UCS 5.0-0 the AD-Connector had an issue with rewriting
   mixed case AD DNs in the presence of a custom `position_mapping`.
   This problem has been fixed, so that mixed case DNs from AD are
   mapped properly to UCS LDAP DNs again, avoiding unintelligible rejects.
