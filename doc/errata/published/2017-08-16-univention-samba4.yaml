fix: 5.0.4-12.698.201708022014
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * Run samba-tool dbcheck --cross-ncs --fix --yes on update if there are
   inconsistencies. A backup of /var/lib/samba/private is performed and
   the fix is skipped if the available disk space is too low.
 * Don't re-provision if univention-samba4 gets uninstalled and re-installed.
 * Assure that /etc/machine.secret works against Samba on re-joined
   S4-Connector DC and abort re-provision if there are SIDs in sam.ldb which
   would get re-assigned and syncronized to OpenLDAP.
