fix: 8.4.22lts4-0.26.201509171802
version: [6,7]
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * Denial of service due to double-free after authentication timeout
   (CVE-2015-3165)
 * Information disclosure due to missing checks of return codes from
   the standard library (CVE-2015-3166)
 * Inconsistent error messages from contrib/pgcrypto (CVE-2015-3167)
 * Fix rare failure to invalidate relation cache init file (Tom Lane)
   With just the wrong timing of concurrent activity, a VACUUM  FULL
   on a system catalog might fail to update the init file that's used to
   avoid cache-loading work for new sessions.  This would result in
   later sessions being unable to access that catalog at all.
   This is a very ancient bug, but it's so hard to trigger that no
   reproducible case had been seen until recently. (No CVE)
