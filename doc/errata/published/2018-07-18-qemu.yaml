 This update addresses the following issues:
 * Systems with microprocessors utilizing speculative execution and indirect
   branch prediction may allow unauthorized disclosure of information to an
   attacker with local user access via a side-channel analysis.
   (CVE-2017-5715)
 * Race condition in the v9fs_xattrwalk function in hw/9pfs/9p.c allows local
   guest OS users to obtain sensitive information from host heap memory via
   vectors related to reading extended attributes. (CVE-2017-15038)
 * Reject options larger than 32M (CVE-2017-15119)
 * VNC server implementation was found to be vulnerable to an unbounded memory
   allocation issue, as it did not throttle the framebuffer updates sent to
   its client. If the client did not consume these updates, VNC server
   allocates growing memory to hold onto this data. A malicious remote VNC
   client could use this flaw to cause DoS to the server host.
   (CVE-2017-15124)
 * QEMU allows remote attackers to cause a memory leak by triggering slow
   data-channel read operations, related to io/channel-websock.c.
   (CVE-2017-15268)
 * The mode4and5 write functions in hw/display/cirrus_vga.c allow local OS
   guest privileged users to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds write
   access and QEMU process crash) via vectors related to dst calculation.
   (CVE-2017-15289)
 * hw/input/ps2.c in QEMU does not validate 'rptr' and 'count' values during
   guest migration, leading to out-of-bounds access. (CVE-2017-16845)
 * The Virtio Vring implementation in QEMU allows local OS guest users to
   cause a denial of service (divide-by-zero error and QEMU process crash) by
   unsetting vring alignment while updating Virtio rings. (CVE-2017-17381)
 * Integer overflow in the macro ROUND_UP (n, d) allows a user to cause a
   denial of service (QEMU process crash). (CVE-2017-18043)
 * The vga_draw_text function allows local OS guest privileged users to cause
   a denial of service (out-of-bounds read and QEMU process crash) by
   leveraging improper memory address validation. (CVE-2018-5683)
 * The load_multiboot function in hw/i386/multiboot.c allows local guest OS
   users to execute arbitrary code on the QEMU host via a mh_load_end_addr
   value greater than mh_bss_end_addr, which triggers an out-of-bounds read or
   write memory access. (CVE-2018-7550)
