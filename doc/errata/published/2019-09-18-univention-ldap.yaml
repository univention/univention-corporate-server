desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue:
 * The UCR templates for LDAP ACL's on DC Slave systems have been split
   from 60univention-ldap-server_acl-slave into
   60univention-ldap-server_acl-slave and
   70univention-ldap-server_acl-slave-end. The rule which allows read access
   for every user to every object is contained in the later one.
   This increases security for templates which are installed on the DC Master
   and DC Slaves where the same behavior is now present.
