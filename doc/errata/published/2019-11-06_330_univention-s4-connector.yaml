fix: 13.0.2-57A~4.4.0.201910291818
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * The logging of UDM related debug messages has been improved. This
   can be controlled by the UCR variable connector/debug/udm/level.
 * The error handling for already removed objects has been improved.
 * The detection of equal DN's when moving objects has been enhanced.
 * The use of the function normalise_userAccountControl() has been replaced
   in mapping.py with a static mapping.
 * The UDM modules container/msgpo, settings/msprintconnectionpolicy and
   settings/mswmifilter have been modernized.
 * DNS host records without IP addresses are now synchronized to Samba/AD.
 * The renamed DNS records are now correctly removed from Samba/AD when the
   object in UCS was renamed.
 * The time conversion of the attribute accountExpires/userexpiry in the
   connector has been fixed to prevent a loop in the s4connector
   which incremented userexpiry on certain timezones.
