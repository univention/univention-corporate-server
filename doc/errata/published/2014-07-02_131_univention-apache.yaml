    This update fixes the following issues:
    * The URL of the Univention App Center landing page has changed. Therefore,
      the corresponding links in the UCS overview page have been adapted.
    * Links to local web interfaces of installed Apps were placed on top of the
      UCS overview page if no priority was specified via UCR. They will now be
      positioned at the end.
