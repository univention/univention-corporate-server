 This update addresses the following issues:
 * CVE-2023-2454: A flaw was found in PostgreSQL. Certain database calls
   could permit an attacker with elevated database-level privileges to
   execute arbitrary code.
 * CVE-2023-2455: A flaw was found in PostgreSQL, which could permit
   incorrect policies being applied in certain cases where role-specific
   policies are used and a given query is planned under one role and executed
   under other roles. This scenario can happen under security definer
   functions, or when a common user and query is planned initially and then
   re-used across multiple SET ROLEs. Applying an incorrect policy may permit
   a user to complete otherwise forbidden reads and modifications. This only
   affects databases that have used CREATE POLICY to define a row security
   policy.
