   value attributes. Before '--set attribute=' had to be used.
 * Some old code which handled custom attributes has been removed.
 * The object class of extended options is now always added or removed to the
   object without the need to change an attribute.
 * The extended attribute option to remove the object class if it is no longer
   needed has been re-enabled.
 * The attribute sambaPwdLastSet is now set for computer objects while
   changing the password.
