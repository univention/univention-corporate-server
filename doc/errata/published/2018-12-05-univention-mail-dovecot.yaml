 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * When creating users, an SSL error occurred when uploading the initial
   Sieve script if the Dovecot server used an external SSL certificate
   from Let's Encrypt, for example. The new UCR variable
   mail/dovecot/sieve/client/server can now be used to specify an external
   FQDN for the Sieve script upload that matches the external SSL
   certificate. (Bug #41018).
