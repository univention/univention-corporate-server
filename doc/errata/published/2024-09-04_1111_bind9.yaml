 This update addresses the following issues:
 * CVE-2024-1975: If a server hosts a zone containing a "KEY" Resource Record,
   or a resolver DNSSEC-validates a "KEY" Resource Record from a DNSSEC-signed
   domain in cache, a client can exhaust resolver CPU resources by sending
   a stream of SIG(0) signed requests.
 * CVE-2024-1737: Resolver caches and authoritative zone databases
   that hold significant numbers of RRs for the same hostname (of any RTYPE)
   can suffer from degraded performance as content is being added or updated,
   and also when handling client queries for this name.
 * CVE-2023-4408: Parsing large DNS messages may cause excessive CPU load
