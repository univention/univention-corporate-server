fix: 1.42.5-1.1.42.201509111046
version: [3]
desc: |
  Multiple security vulnerabilities have been fixed in e2fsprogs:
  * Heap-based buffer overflow in openfs.c in the libext2fs library
    in e2fsprogs before 1.42.12 allows local users to execute
    arbitrary code via crafted block group descriptor data in a
    filesystem image (CVE-2015-0247).
  * Heap-based buffer overflow in closefs.c in the libext2fs library
    in e2fsprogs before 1.42.12 allows local users to execute
    arbitrary code by causing a crafted block group descriptor to be
    marked as dirty. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an
    incomplete fix for CVE-2015-0247 (CVE-2015-1572).
