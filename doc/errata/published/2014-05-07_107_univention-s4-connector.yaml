fix: 8.0.33-46.472.201405062002
version: [1]
desc: |
  This update fixes the following issues:
  * The S4 connector Python modules are now only built for Python 2.6.
  * The pcpatch user is no longer ignored by default.
  * The start of multiple S4 connector instances is now prevented.
  * When creating a user in UCS a stronger password is used which
    fulfill the password complexity settings.
  * The UCR variable connector/s4/listener/disabled has been added.
    If it is set to true the listener does not write any changes.
    This is helpful on a domain controller backup. The variable is
    not set by default during this upgrade.
  * During the group membership synchronization from Samba 4 to
    OpenLDAP an object mapping problem has been fixed.
