fix: 12.0.2-29A~4.3.0.201809051616
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * The S4-Connector no longer updates the obsolete attribute
   sambaPwdMustChange.
 * When "password change on next login" had been activated for a user
   the S4-Connector removed "shadowMax" and "krb5PasswordEnd" and reset
   "shadowLastChange" to 0 when synchronizing changes back from Samba/AD to
   UDM/OpenLDAP. In an UCS@school specific UMC module this caused a display
   issue, where the next required password change was shown as "never".
   This behavior has been fixed.
