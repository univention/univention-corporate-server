fix: 6:11.12-1~deb8u5
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * libavcodec/utils.c omits a certain codec ID during enforcement of
   alignment, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
   (out-of-bounds access) or possibly have unspecified other impact via
   crafted JV data. (CVE-2014-8542)
 * Double-free vulnerability in libavformat/mov.c allows remote attackers to
   cause a denial of service (memory corruption and crash) via a crafted .m4a
   file. (CVE-2015-1207)
 * FFmpeg has an out-of-bounds write caused by a heap-based buffer overflow
   related to the decode_frame_common function in libavcodec/pngdec.c.
   (CVE-2017-7863)
 * FFmpeg has an out-of-bounds write caused by a heap-based buffer overflow
   related to the ipvideo_decode_block_opcode_0xA function in
   libavcodec/interplayvideo.c and the avcodec_align_dimensions2 function in
   libavcodec/utils.c. (CVE-2017-7865)
 * In the mxf_read_primer_pack function in libavformat/mxfdec.c an integer
   signedness error might occur when a crafted file, which claims a large
   "item_num" field such as 0xffffffff, is provided. As a result, the variable
   "item_num" turns negative, bypassing the check for a large value.
   (CVE-2017-14169)
 * In libavformat/asfdec_f.c, a DoS in asf_build_simple_index() due to lack of
   an EOF (End of File) check might cause huge CPU consumption. When a crafted
   ASF file, which claims a large "ict" field in the header but does not
   contain sufficient backing data, is provided, the for loop would consume
   huge CPU and memory resources, since there is no EOF check inside the loop.
   (CVE-2017-14223)
