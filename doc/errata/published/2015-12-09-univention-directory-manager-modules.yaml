 This update addresses the following issues:
 * The locale is not replaced by the Country syntax class anymore. This caused
   side effects in all processes which imported the UDM python modules. For
   example the translation of the appcenter UMC modules was not possible
   (Bug #39146).
 * From now on domain names for mail domains will be lowercased when created
   or modified. Existing domain names will not be changed automatically, only
   when they are modified. Mixed case domain names caused inconsistent
   behaviour with Dovecot and shared folders (Bug #39721).
