fix: 2:4.6.1-1A~4.2.0.201803051359
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue:
 * Samba is vulnerable to a denial of service attack when the RPC spoolss
   service is configured to be run as an external daemon. Missing input
   sanitization checks on some of the input parameters to spoolss RPC calls
   could cause the print spooler service to crash. There is no known
   vulnerability associated with this error, merely a denial of service.
   If the RPC spoolss service is left by default as an internal service,
   all a client can do is crash its own authenticated connection
   (CVE-2018-1050).
 * On a Samba/AD DC the LDAP server incorrectly validates permissions to
   modify passwords over LDAP allowing authenticated users to change any
   other users passwords, including administrative users (CVE-2018-1057).
