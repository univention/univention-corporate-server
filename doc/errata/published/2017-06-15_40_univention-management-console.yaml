 * The PAM configuration has been adjusted to make password changes
   possible again if the password was expired.
 * The error handling on module initialization has been improved.
 * If the URL to access UMC contained a Port a XSRF-Attack was wrong
   detected causing UMC to be unusable. This has been fixed.

 * A notification about the Administrator account is shown when trying
   to login as root.
