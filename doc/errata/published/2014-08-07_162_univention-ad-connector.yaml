  This update fixes the following issues:
  * Support for the ad/member mode has been added.
  * In some cases a removed group membership was not synchronized from OpenLDAP
    to Active Directory in write mode.
  * The AD certificate chain is no longer checked if there is no root
    certificate configured.
  * Kerberos support has been added to the UCS AD connector.
  * A script has been added for renaming groups and users with Well Known SIDs
    to the corresponding name in the AD domain. This script is for internal use
    by the setup wizard for the UCS in AD member mode.
  * A script has been added to grand read permission to the CN=Deleted Objects
    container in Active Directory. This is only required for the AD Member mode.
