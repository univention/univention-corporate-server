fix: 1:11.13.1~dfsg-2~bpo70+1.20.201711011501
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * SSL protocol BEAST vulnerability in HTTP server (CVE-2011-3389)
 * When registering a SIP TLS device, asterisk does not properly handle a
   null byte in a domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) field of
   an X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof
   arbitrary SSL servers via a crafted certificate issued by a legitimate
   Certification Authority (CVE-2015-3008)
 * Remote authenticated users can cause a denial of service (uninitialized
   pointer dereference and crash) via a zero length error correcting
   redundancy packet for a UDPTL FAX packet that is lost (CVE-2016-2232)
 * Remote denial of service (file descriptor consumption) via vectors
   related to large retransmit timeout values (CVE-2016-2316)
 * Remote denial of service (port exhaustion) in chain_sip (CVE-2016-7551)
 * Non-printable ASCII chars treated as whitespace (CVE-2016-9938)
 * In res/res_rtp_asterisk.c unauthorized data disclosure (media takeover
   in the RTP stack) is possible with careful timing by an attacker. The
   "strictrtp" option in rtp.conf enables a feature of the RTP stack that
   learns the source address of media for a session and drops any packets
   that do not originate from the expected address. This option is enabled
   by default in Asterisk 11 and above. The "nat" and "rtp_symmetric"
   options (for chan_sip and chan_pjsip, respectively) enable symmetric RTP
   support in the RTP stack. This uses the source address of incoming media
   as the target address of any sent media. This option is not enabled by
   default, but is commonly enabled to handle devices behind NAT. A change
   was made to the strict RTP support in the RTP stack to better tolerate
   late media when a reinvite occurs. When combined with the symmetric RTP
   support, this introduced an avenue where media could be hijacked. Instead
   of only learning a new address when expected, the new code allowed a new
   source address to be learned at all times. If a flood of RTP traffic was
   received, the strict RTP support would allow the new address to provide
   media, and (with symmetric RTP enabled) outgoing traffic would be sent to
   this new address, allowing the media to be hijacked. Provided the attacker
   continued to send traffic, they would continue to receive traffic as well.
   (CVE-2017-14099)
 * Unauthorized command execution is possible. The app_minivm module has an
   "externnotify" program configuration option that is executed by the
   MinivmNotify dialplan application. The application uses the caller-id
   name and number as part of a built string passed to the OS shell for
   interpretation and execution. Since the caller-id name and number can
   come from an untrusted source, a crafted caller-id name or number allows
   an arbitrary shell command injection. (CVE-2017-14100)
 * insufficient RTCP packet validation could allow reading stale buffer
   contents and when combined with the "nat" and "symmetric_rtp" options
   allow redirecting where Asterisk sends the next RTCP report
   (CVE-2017-14603)
