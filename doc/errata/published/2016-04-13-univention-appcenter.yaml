 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * Improved the image gallery in the details page of an app. The
   handling of YouTube videos has been improved and enlarging
   thumbnails is smoother.
 * A helptext still mentioned the Free-for-personal-Use Edition. This
   has been replaced with the UCS Core Edition.
 * The overview of software changes has been enhanced.
 * A margin has been added to the footer buttons of the installation
   error page.
 * Join scripts and unjoin scripts are now correctly removed while
   installing and uninstalling an App.
 * Minor code changes make other projects easier that rely on the App
   Center.
 * univention-app shell now correctly exits with the exit code of the
   called command.
 * univention-app installed unsigned packages.
 * The "Package Management" module can be opened via hash again.
 * Details of software packages can be shown again.
 * The installation status of Docker Apps was determined incorrectly
   by certain functions of the App Center. This has been fixed.
 * Joinscripts of Docker Apps are run via univention-run-join-scripts
   instead of being called directly.
