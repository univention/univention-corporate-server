fix: 14.0.12-35A~4.4.0.201905141649
desc: |-
  This update addresses the following issues:
  * Explicit initialization of the default values of UDM properties has been
    removed from the code of all UDM modules.
  * The users/user UDM module now uses the ldap filter
    "univentionObjectType=users/user" when searching for objects to increase
    performance.
  * When opening container objects, a lookup is performed to check whether
    this container is the default container for certain UDM objects. This
    lookup is now cached which makes opening many objects at once considerably
    faster.
  * After renaming an object the internal DN (self.dn) is updated correctly.
    The old DN can now be obtained via self.old_dn. This fixes the concurrent
    renaming and update of group membership for e.g. computer objects.
  * Several german translations have been updated.
