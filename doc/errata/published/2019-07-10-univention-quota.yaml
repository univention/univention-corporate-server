desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * Previously, when quota policies were set on multiple shares that are
   located on the same mountpoint, a quota policy that had a value of zero
   (meaning no quota is enforced) would overwrite smaller quota policies.
   This behaviour has been changed to always choose the smallest value.
