fix: 9.0.75-30.1192.201404161441
version: [1]
desc: |
  * The users/user udm module and the license check have been extended
    to ignore certain LDAP objects with the attribute
    univentionObjectFlag:functional.
  * Python UDM extensions are now installed with update-python-support.
  * The "default" attribute of an UDM object's property is now configurable via
    UCR (e.g. by setting
    directory/manager/web/modules/users/user/properties/mailHomeServer/default).
  * The dependency list of the package has been updated. Prior to this change,
    slapd was left installed on a memberserver when using the appliance mode
    which could lead to problems when this system was querying LDAP.
  * UDM no longer creates temporary objects in cn=univention when moving
    containers, because cn=univention is ignored by the S4 connector and the S4
    connector does not recognize the move.
