desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * CVE-2024-36387: Serving WebSocket protocol upgrades over a HTTP/2
   connection could result in a NULL Pointer dereference
 * CVE-2024-38476: SSRF or local script execution via backend applications
   whose response headers are malicious or exploitable
 * CVE-2024-38477: a NULL pointer dereference was found in `mod_proxy`
   allowing an attacker to crash the server via a malicious request.
 * CVE-2024-38573: A potential SSRF in mod_rewrite allowed an attacker to
   cause unsafe RewriteRules to unexpectedly setup URL's to be handled by
   mod_proxy.
 * CVE-2024-39884: A regression of CVE-2024-38476 in the core of Apache
   HTTP Server ignores some use of the legacy content-type based configuration
   of handlers. `AddType` and similar configuration, under some circumstances
   where files are requested indirectly, result in source code disclosure of
   local content. For example, PHP scripts may be served instead of
   interpreted.
 * CVE-2024-40725: A partial fix for CVE-2024-38476 in the core of Apache
   HTTP Server ignores some use of the legacy content-type based configuration
   of handlers. `AddType` and similar configuration, under some circumstances
   where files are requested indirectly, result in source code disclosure of
   local content. For example, PHP scripts may be served instead of
   interpreted.
