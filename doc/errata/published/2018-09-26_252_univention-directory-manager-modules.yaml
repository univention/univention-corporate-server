  This update addresses the following issue(s):
  * Allow to customize portal with about page
  * It is now possible to define custom categories for the portal.
  * User Templates now have access to the alphanum option.
  * For performance reasons, UDM stores the last used value of uidNumber
    and gidNumber in an LDAP object in the univentionLastUsedValue
    attribute. Usually these two values are monotonously increasing with
    automatic assignment. When manually specifying the uidNumber/gidNumber
    when creating an object, however, this value could jump back to a lower
    value and previously used and now free values could be reused if
    necessary. This behavior has now been disabled. univentionLastUsedValue
    is now monotonously increasing.
  * The visibility of a portal entry object can now be restricted
    to multiple groups instead of just one.
  * The search filter generated for boolean and multi-value properties
    of UDM objects was not correct. This has been resolved.
  * Fix a traceback during portal assignment at computer objects when a
    settings/portal object is created.
