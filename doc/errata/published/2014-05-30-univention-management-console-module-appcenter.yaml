fix: 3.0.51-22.256.201407011022
version: [2]
desc: |
  This update fixes the following issues:
  * Improved performance: Applications are opened immediately when clicking on
    them from the app gallery.
  * Improved performance: When new apps are added or existing apps' meta
    information changes, new files need to be downloaded from the server. If
    many files have changed, instead of downloading them all one after another,
    a compiled archive is downloaded and the files are extracted. This also
    fixes issues with many concurrent connections opened on the App Center
    server.
  * A dedicated component for the Radius application is removed (if Radius is
    installed). It was added by mistake as 'univention-radius' is part of the
    main repository.
  * The UCR variable repository/app_center/installed is now set and kept
    up-to-date. It reflects the state of the installation status of all apps.
  * The details of an application do not show the note whether this application
    sends information to the vendor or not if it is a UCS component.
