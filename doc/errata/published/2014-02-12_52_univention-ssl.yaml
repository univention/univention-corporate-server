version: [0]
desc: |
 The permissions for the directory "/etc/univention/ssl" and the files contained
 in it where mangled on certificate renewal via the UMC "System Setup" module.
 New certificates created using "univention-certificate new" were created with
 incorrect permissions.
 This update fixes these issues, making sure that the group "DC Backup Hosts"
 has access to the certificates.
