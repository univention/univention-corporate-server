 This update addresses the following issues:
 * CVE-2021-2154: An Easily exploitable vulnerability allowed high privileged
   attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise `MySQL`
   Server. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized
   ability to cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash (complete DOS). The
   `UDF_INIT()` function caused a crash.
 * CVE-2021-2166: An Easily exploitable vulnerability allowed high privileged
   attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise `MySQL`
   Server. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized
   ability to cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash (complete DOS).
   Plugin variables in `SET` were not correctly locked.
 * CVE-2021-2194: An Easily exploitable vulnerability allowed high privileged
   attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise `MySQL`
   Server. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized
   ability to cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash (complete DOS). In
   Full-text phrase search, `MariaDB` filter out row that do not contain all
   the tokens in the phrase. If `MariaDB` do not filter out `doc_id` that
   doesn't appear in all the token's `doc_id` lists then hit an assert.
 * CVE-2021-2389: An Easily exploitable vulnerability allowed high privileged
   attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise `MySQL`
   Server. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized
   ability to cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash (complete DOS).
   Server throws OOM error when we execute twitter load with `SELECTs` for
   `UPDATE` + `UPDATES`, and `SELECT` queries on tables with full-text index.
 * CVE-2021-46657: get_sort_by_table in MariaDB allowed an application crash
   via certain subquery uses of `ORDER BY`.
 * CVE-2021-46661: `MariaDB` allowed an application crash in
   `find_field_in_tables` and find_order_in_list via an unused common table
   expression (CTE).
 * CVE-2021-46663: `MariaDB` allowed a `ha_maria::extra application` crash via
   certain `SELECT` statements.
 * CVE-2021-46664: `MariaDB` crashed in `sub_select_postjoin_aggr` for a
   `NULL` value of `aggr`.
 * CVE-2021-46665: `MariaDB` crashed because of incorrect `used_tables`
   expectations.
 * CVE-2021-46666: `MariaDB` crashed because of mishandling of a pushdown from
   a `HAVING` clause to a `WHERE` clause.
 * CVE-2021-46667: MariadDB was vulnerable due to a `sql_lex.cc` integer
   overflow, leading to an application crash.
 * CVE-2021-46668: `MariaDB` crashed via certain long `SELECT DISTINCT`
   statements that improperly interact with storage-engine resource
   limitations for temporary data structures.
 * CVE-2021-46669: `MariaDB` allowed attackers to trigger a
   `convert_const_to_int use-after-free` when the `BIGINT` data type is used.
