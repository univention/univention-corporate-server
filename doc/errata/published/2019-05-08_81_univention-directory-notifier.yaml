desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue:
 * Implement command "univention-translog prune" to prune old transactions
   from the 'transaction' file and database. This can be used to save space.
 Warning: This procedure is dangerous and should ONLY be executed if ALL
 Univention Directory Listeners (UDL) in the domain have processed all
 previous transactions. Otherwise the UDLs will no longer be able to process
 transactions and affected systems must be re-joined!
 Systems, which have not been running for some time or are restored from
 backup, must also be re-joined if their last processed transaction is no
 longer part contained in the purged translog.
