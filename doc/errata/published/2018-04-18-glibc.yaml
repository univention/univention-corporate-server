desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue:
 * glibc contains a vulnerability that allows specially crafted
   LD_LIBRARY_PATH values to manipulate the heap/stack, causing them to alias,
   potentially resulting in arbitrary code execution. Please note that
   additional hardening changes have been made to glibc to prevent
   manipulation of stack and heap memory but these issues are not directly
   exploitable, as such they have not been given a CVE. (CVE-2017-1000366)
