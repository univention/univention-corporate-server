fix: 11.0.2-23.1378.201603081544
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * Some ldap search requests have been optimized in the handler modules.
 * In situations where the IP address of a created computer contained two
   equal blocks (e.g. 10.10.20.0/24) invalid pointer records were created.
 * The layout of DNS service and text records have been adjusted to be more
   readable.
 * It is now prevented to create extended attributes for users with required
   fields without specifying a default value. Those extended attributes caused
   problems during upgrading to UCS 4.1 or installing various apps.
 * The search filter for "name" in the dns/dns module now also finds zones and
   pointer records.
 * The search filter for "dhcpPermitList" in the dhcp/pool lookup function has
   been fixed.
 * The search filter for "fqdn" has been adapted so it can be used to search
   for multiple computers.
 * Some columns which show more information in the grid of UMC have been added
   to the DNS handler modules.
