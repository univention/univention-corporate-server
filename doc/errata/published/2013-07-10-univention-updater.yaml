  This update fixes several issues with local repositories:
  * The recommendation for setting up a UCR policy has been fixed to mention
    the correct UCR variable 'updater/secure_apt'.
  * A locally required and mirrored component from a separate repository in
    same cases blocked the update of the local repository. This has been changed
    to now always update the local repository as soon as a new release is
    available. The condition is still check by each host individually.
  * The pre- and post-updater scripts of locally mirrored but disabled
    components are now also retrieved.
  * On a local repository server a repository policy no longer sets the source
    server to itself.
