 This update addresses the following issues:
 * Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows high privileged attacker with
   logon to the infrastructure where MySQL Server executes to compromise MySQL
   Server. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized
   access to critical data or complete access to all MySQL Server accessible
   data. (CVE-2017-10268)
 * Easily exploitable vulnerability allows low privileged attacker with
   network access via multiple protocols to compromise MySQL Server.
   Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized ability
   to cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash (complete DOS) of MySQL
   Server. (CVE-2017-10384)
 * Easily exploitable vulnerability allows low privileged attacker with
   network access via multiple protocols to compromise MySQL Server.
   Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized access
   to critical data or complete access to all MySQL Server accessible data.
