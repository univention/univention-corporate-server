desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * `ucs_registerLDAPExtension` from the Univention shell function library now
   allows the option `umcmessagecatalog`. This option can be used to supply
   translation files in GNU message catalog format for the UMC.
 * The simple UDM API now exposes the `remove_childs` option of UDM's
   `remove()` function in the `delete()` method to recursively delete objects
   below the DN of the object that is being deleted.
