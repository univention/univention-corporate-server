desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * Apps may define ports they want to occupy exclusively. Docker Apps checked
   before installation whether an already installed App excepts exclusive
   access to one of these ports. This check has been extended to Non-Docker
   Apps.
 * Apps now show general information about the terms under which the software
   may be used. If the App ships a license file, it may be read before and
   after installation.
 * Internal adaptations have been added to allow for extending App Center
   functionalities.
