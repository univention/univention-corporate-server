  This update addresses the following issue(s):
  * Properties that have been set to default values are no
    longer ignored when saving from the UDM detail page.
  * Join script uses bindpwdfile option, added bindpwdfile support
    in univention-dnsedit.
  * Prevent the removal of groups that are mentioned in the settings/default
    object. These groups are used for new objects and therefore must exist.
