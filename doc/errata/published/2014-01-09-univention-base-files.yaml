desc: |
 NTP servers reachable from the internet that respond to the "monlist" query can
 be used to facilitate distributed denial of service attacks (CVE-2013-5211).
 This update adds the UCR variable "ntp/noquery" which can be set to "true" to
 disable most queries including the "monlist" function and thus mitigates this
 issue. The regular time service of NTP will continue to serve time updates
 independent of the value of the variable.
 After setting the variable the NTP service needs to be restarted in the
 "System services" module of the Univention Management Console or with the
 command "/etc/init.d/ntp restart". It is recommended to set this variable on
 UCS systems that exposes the NTP service to the internet.
