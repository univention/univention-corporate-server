 This update addresses the following issue(s):

   users and groups. This avoids rejects if the Univention S4 Connector is 
   not installed on the DC master in a distributed UCS@school environment.
 * The slave PDC host account is now demoted from the central Samba in a 
   distributed UCS@school environment.
 * The school OU was not defined while joining a new Windows client. This
   issue has been fixed.
