  When an object is renamed in LDAP, the old relative distinguished name (RDN)
  values are kept by default. This leads to situations, where an attribute
  declared as single-valued may become multi-valued, which breaks the
  replication to Samba 4 and confuses several other listener modules.
  This erratum changes the low-level Univention LDAP code to remove the old RDN
  values as well, as all other code paths already do so.
