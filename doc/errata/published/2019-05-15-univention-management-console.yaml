desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * The design of the UMC login page can now be adjusted via
   /usr/share/univention-management-console-login/css/custom.css.
 * The UMC-Server does not respond with an error anymore if no English
   locale is configured.
 * LDAP connection problems could result in an error loop, with the following
   error "ldapError: Insufficient access". This has been fixed by ensuring a
   new connection is used after LDAP connection problems.
