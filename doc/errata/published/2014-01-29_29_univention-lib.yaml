  This errata update fixes several issues:
  * adjust the behaviour of ucs_registerLDAPExtension to let
    join scripts continue in case an LDAP extension could not
    be registered because a newer one is already active in the
    domain.
  * Group name mapping has been added to univention-lib.
    The new function "custom_groupname" maps the default group names
    to the actual name.
  * User name mapping has been added to univention-lib.
    The new function "custom_username" maps the default user names
    to the actual name.
  * A new python lib (s4) has been added for Samba-related operations.
