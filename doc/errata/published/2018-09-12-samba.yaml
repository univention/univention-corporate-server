desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * When joining a new Samba/AD DC, Samba replicates all LDAP partitions
   independently. Depending on timing the replication of the linked attribute
   "serverReference" could fail, if CN=Configuration gets replicated before
   the main domain partition. As a result DRS replication could fail.
