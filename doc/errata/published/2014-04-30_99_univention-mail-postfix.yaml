fix: 8.0.11-3.213.201404161145
version: [1]
desc: |
  This update fixes the following issues:
  * The Postfix policy service listfilter (to restrict e-mail delivery to
    groups and lists) is now executed as the user listfilter instead of the user
    cyrus to allow this feature also in environments without the component
    univention-mail-cyrus.
  * The new UCR variables
     - mail/postfix/ldaptable/starttls (yes)
     - mail/postfix/ldaptable/tlsrequirecert (yes)
     - mail/postfix/ldaptable/tlscacertfile (/etc/univention/ssl/ucsCA/CAcert.pem)
    have been introduced to define whether and how the postfix should use
    TLS for LDAP lookups.
