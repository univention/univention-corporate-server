fix: 2.0.15-3.142.201308271124
note:
version: [1]
desc: |
  * During the update from UCS-3.0 to UCS-3.1 the template for
    /etc/network/interfaces was converted from a single-file template
    into a multi-file template. To preserve modifications to the
    template, the original template was moved to the new location.

    This causes an error with the network tools, since the declaration
    of the loopback interface was separated into its own template
    fragment and now appears twice in the generated file.

    On installing this erratum, the duplicate declaration for the
    loopback interface is commented out from the moved template files.

  * During the update the automatic restart of the network is disabled.

  * This errata enables the kernel inotify parameters to be controlled by
    Univention Config Registry variables. The default values have been
    increased to improve support of large environments. The following 
    Univention Config Registry variables are available:
     * kernel/fs/inotify/max_user_instances (default:   512)
     * kernel/fs/inotify/max_user_watches   (default: 32768)
     * kernel/fs/inotify/max_queued_events  (default: 16384)
    IMPORTANT:
    If these parameters have been manually defined in a local file below 
    /etc/sysctl.d/ the file should be removed and the configured values 
    transfered to the respective Univention Config Registry variables.
