   to cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash (complete DOS) of MySQL
   Server. (CVE-2018-2761)
 * Easily exploitable vulnerability allows low privileged attacker with
   network access via multiple protocols to compromise MySQL Server.
   Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized ability
   to cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash (complete DOS) of MySQL
   Server. (CVE-2018-2819)
 * Easily exploitable vulnerability allows high privileged attacker with
   network access via multiple protocols to compromise MySQL Server.
   Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized ability
   to cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash (complete DOS) of MySQL
   Server. (CVE-2018-2818)
 * Easily exploitable vulnerability allows low privileged attacker with
   network access via multiple protocols to compromise MySQL Server.
