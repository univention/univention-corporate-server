  This errata fixes several problems:
  * The UMC Server could crash when a new UDM module with new UDM syntax classes
    was added.
  * Several syntax classes received lookup optimizations that result in faster
    opening of objects in the UDM frontend especially in larger environments.
  * During license check temporary user objects are no longer taken into account.
