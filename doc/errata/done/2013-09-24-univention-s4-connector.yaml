fix: 7.0.32-10.412.201310071024
note:
version: [1]
desc: |
  This errata update fixes the following issues in the package univention-s4-connector:
  * A server password change script has been added. The S4 connector will be restarted
    in case it uses the machine account.
  * The S4 connector now considers the scenario that an object was moved to a position
    which is not replicated to this server. This is for example the case in UCS@school.
  * The S4 connector no longer synchronizes the password for Slave PDC DCs from
    Samba 4 to OpenLDAP. This prevents a synchronization loop in some selective
    replication scenarios.
