	<chapter id="relnotes:order">
		<title>Recommended update order for environments with more than one UCS server</title>

		<para>
			In environments with more than one UCS system, the update order of the UCS systems must be borne in mind:
		</para>

		<para>
			The authoritative version of the LDAP directory service is maintained on the &ucsMaster; and replicated on all the remaining LDAP servers of the UCS domain.
			As changes to the LDAP schemes can occur during release updates, the &ucsMaster; must always be the first system to be updated during a release update.
		</para>

		<para>
			It is generally advisable to update all UCS systems in one maintenance window whenever possible.
		</para>
	</chapter>

	<chapter id="relnotes:prepare">
		<title>Preparation of update</title>

		<para>
			It must be checked whether sufficient disk space is available.
			A standard installation requires a minimum of 6 GB of disk space.
			Depending on the scope of the existing installation, the update will require at least another 1 GB of disk space for the downloading and installation of the packages.
		</para>

		<para>
			For the update, a login should be performed on the system's local console as user <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem>, and the update should be initiated there.
			Alternatively, the update can be conducted using &ucsUMC;.
		</para>

		<para>
			Remote updating via SSH is not recommended as this may result in the update procedure being cancelled, e.g., if the network connection is interrupted.
			In consequence, this can affect the system severely.
			If updating should occur over a network connection nevertheless, it must be verified that the update continues despite disconnection from the network.
			This can be done, e.g., using the tools <command>screen</command> and <command>at</command>.  These tools are installed on all system roles by default.
		</para>

		<para>
			It is possible to skip the upgrade to UCS 3.3. If the system should be upgraded directly from UCS 3.2 to UCS 4, the &ucsUCRV; <envar>update33/skip/ucs3.3</envar> has to be
			set to <literal>true</literal>.
		</para>
	</chapter>

	<chapter id="relnotes:post">
		<title>Postprocessing of the update</title>

		<para>
			Following the update, new or updated join scripts need to be executed.
			This can be done in two ways:
			Either using the UMC module  <guimenu>Domain join</guimenu> or by running the command <command>univention-run-join-scripts</command> as user <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem>.
		</para>

		<para>
			Subsequently the UCS system needs to be restarted.
		</para>

		<section id="relnotes:kernel">
			<title>Physical Address Extension</title>
			<para>
				  The Linux kernel was updated to version 3.16.7-ckt25.
				  32 bit systems without <abbrev>PAE</abbrev> support (physical address extension) are no longer supported.
			</para>
		</section>
		<section id="relnotes:usage">
			<title>Collection of usage statistics when using the <phrase>free-for-personal-use</phrase> version</title>
			<para>
				Anonymous usage statistics on the use of &ucsUMC; are collected when using the <phrase>free for personal use</phrase> version of UCS (which is generally used for evaluating UCS).
				The modules opened are logged in an instance of the web traffic analysis tool Piwik.
				This makes it possible for Univention to tailor the development of &ucsUMC; better to customer needs and carry out usability improvements.
			</para>
			<para>
				This logging is only performed when the <phrase>free-for-personal-use</phrase> license is used.
				The license status can be verified by clicking on the cog symbol in the top right corner of the &ucsUMC; and selecting <guimenu>License information</guimenu>.
				If <phrase>Free for personal use edition</phrase> is listed under <guimenu>License type</guimenu>, this version is in use.
				When a regular UCS license is used, no usage statistics are collected.
			</para>
			<para>
				Independent of the license used, the statistics generation can be deactivated by setting the &ucsUCRV; <envar>umc/web/piwik</envar> to <literal>false</literal>.
			</para>
		</section>

		<section id="relnotes:uefi">
			<title>UEFI installation DVD</title>
			<para>
				In addition to the standard installation DVD there is also a medium with support for the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface standard (<acronym>UEFI</acronym>) available for the amd64 architecture.

				WebKit is primarily used for displaying HTML help pages etc.
				Firefox should be used as web browser.
			</para>
		</section>

		<section id="relnotes:browsers">
			<title>Recommended browsers for the access to Univention Management Console</title>

			<para>
				&ucsUMC; uses numerous JavaScript and CSS functions to display the web interface.
