		<para>
			With &ucsUCS; 4.0-3, the third point release of &ucsUCS; (UCS) 4.0 is now available.
			It provides various improvements and bugfixes.
			An overview of the most important changes:
		</para>

		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem><para>
				The mail server Dovecot has been integrated as standard IMAP/POP3 server into UCS and offers
				an alternative to the still available Cyrus IMAP server. More information is available in 
				<ulink url="https://www.univention.com/2015/07/dovecot-is-the-default-imappop3-mail-server-in-ucs/">this blog article</ulink>.
			</para></listitem>
			<listitem><para>
				The compatibility to Active Directory has been improved with the Samba update to 4.2.3. This includes, among others, improvements
				in the DRS replication and the printer driver handling. In addition, the join of Huawai storage systems in the Active Directory domain
				provided by UCS is now also possible.
			</para></listitem>
			<listitem><para>
				Several enhancements in design and usability of the Univention Management Console have been implemented. For example, it is now possible
				to use the forward and back buttons of the web browser. This allows a simpler and faster navigation in the management interface.
			</para></listitem>
			<listitem><para>
				LDAP filters can now be defined for LDAP policies. That means the LDAP policy applies only to the objects that match the LDAP filter.
				This makes it possible to use LDAP policies in an easy and generic way especially in large environments.
			</para></listitem>
			<listitem><para>
                The Linux kernel has been updated to the latest stable version of the 3.16 longterm kernel. This includes several security updates
				as well as new and updated drivers for a better hardware support.
			</para></listitem>
			<listitem><para>
				All security updates released for UCS 4.0-2 are included in this update. It is now also possible to redirect all HTTP requests to HTTPS
				by only setting an Univention Configuration Registry variable. This increases the security of the UCS system.
			</para></listitem>

	<chapter id="relnotes:update">
		<title>Notes on the update</title>
		<para>
			During the update some services in the domain may not be available, i.e. the update should occur in a maintenance window.
			It is recommended to test the update in a separate test environment prior to the actual update.
			The test environment should be identical to the production environment.
			Depending on the system performance, network connection and the installed software the update takes between 20 minutes and several hours.
		</para>

		<section id="relnotes:order">
			<title>Recommended update order for environments with more than one UCS server</title>
			<para>
				In environments with more than one UCS system, the update order of the UCS systems must be borne in mind:
			</para>

			<para>
				The authoritative version of the LDAP directory service is maintained on the &ucsMaster; and replicated on all the remaining LDAP servers of the UCS domain.
				As changes to the LDAP schemes can occur during release updates, the &ucsMaster; must always be the first system to be updated during a release update.
			</para>
		</section>

		<section id="relnotes:32bit">
			<title>UCS installation DVDs only available for 64 bit</title>
			<para>
				Starting with UCS 4.0 UCS, installation DVDs are only provided for the x86 64 bit architecture (amd64).
				Existing 32 bit UCS 3 systems can still be updated to UCS 4.0 through the online repository or by using update DVDs.
				The 32 bit architecture will be supported over the entire UCS 4 maintenance.
			</para>
		</section>
	</chapter>

	<chapter id="relnotes:prepare">
		<title>Preparation of update</title>

		<para>
			It must be checked whether sufficient disk space is available.
			A standard installation requires a minimum of 6 GB of disk space.
			Depending on the scope of the existing installation, the update will require about another 2 GB of disk space for downloading and installing all packages.
		</para>

		<para>
			For the update, a login should be performed on the system's local console as user <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem>, and the update should be initiated there.
			Alternatively, the update can be conducted using &ucsUMC;.
		</para>

		<para>
			Remote updating via SSH is not recommended as this may result in the update procedure being cancelled, e.g., if the network connection is interrupted.
			In consequence, this can affect the system severely.
			If updating should occur over a network connection nevertheless, it must be verified that the update continues despite disconnection from the network.
			This can be done, e.g., using the tools <command>screen</command> and <command>at</command>.  These tools are installed on all system roles by default.
		</para>
	</chapter>

	<chapter id="relnotes:post">
		<title>Postprocessing of the update</title>

		<para>
			Following the update, new or updated join scripts need to be executed.
			This can be done in two ways:
			Either using the UMC module  <guimenu>Domain join</guimenu> or by running the command <command>univention-run-join-scripts</command> as user <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem>.
		</para>

		<para>
			Subsequently the UCS system needs to be restarted.
		</para>

		<title>Further notes on selected packages</title>

		<section id="relnotes:instprofil">
			<title>Network-based installation of UCS</title>
			<para>

				Further details are described in <biblioref linkend="ext-doc-inst"/>.
			</para>
		</section>

		<section id="relnotes:usage">
			<title>Collection of usage statistics</title>
			<para>
				Anonymous usage statistics on the use of &ucsUMC; are collected when using the <emphasis>UCS Core Edition</emphasis> version of UCS (which is generally used for evaluating UCS).
				The modules opened are logged in an instance of the web traffic analysis tool Piwik.
				This makes it possible for Univention to tailor the development of &ucsUMC; better to customer needs and carry out usability improvements.
			</para>
			<para>
				This logging is only performed when the <emphasis>UCS Core Edition</emphasis> license is used.
				The license status can be verified via the menu entry <guimenu>License &ar; License information</guimenu> of the user menu in the upper right corner of &ucsUMC;.
				If <guimenu>UCS Core Edition</guimenu> is listed under <guimenu>License type</guimenu>, this version is in use.
				When a regular UCS license is used, no usage statistics are collected.
			</para>
			<para>
				Independent of the license used, the statistics generation can be deactivated by setting the &ucsUCRV; <envar>umc/web/piwik</envar> to <emphasis>false</emphasis>.
			</para>
		</section>

		<section id="relnotes:secbrowsers">
			<title>Scope of security support for WebKit, Konqueror and QtWebKit</title>
			<para>
				WebKit, Konqueror and QtWebKit are shipped in the maintained branch of the UCS repository, but not covered with security support.
				WebKit is primarily used for displaying HTML help pages etc.
				Firefox should be used as web browser.
			</para>

		</section>

		<section id="relnotes:browsers">
			<title>Recommended browsers for the access to Univention Management Console</title>

			<para>
				&ucsUMC; uses numerous JavaScript and CSS functions to display the web interface.
				Cookies need to be permitted in the browser.
				The following browsers are recommended:
