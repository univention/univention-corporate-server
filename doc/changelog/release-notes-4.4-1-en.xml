		<title>Release Highlights</title>

		<para>
			With &ucsUCS; 4.4-1, the fourth minor release of &ucsUCS; (UCS) 4 is now
			available. It provides several feature improvements and extensions, new properties as well as
			various improvements and bugfixes. Here is an overview of the most important changes:
		</para>

		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem><para>
					With this release the new app <phrase>Admin Diary</phrase> is available, with which administrative events of all UCS instances of a domain can be viewed and evaluated centrally.
					Changes to users, groups or other objects in the directory service can be tracked just as easily as updates to servers or (de-)installations of apps.
				</para>
				<para>
					The <phrase>Admin Diary</phrase> is delivered as two components:
					a backend for data storage in an SQL database and a frontend for integration into the UMC.
					Recording of events is part of UCS <productnumber>4.4</productnumber> and is automatically activated when the backend is installed.
			</para></listitem>
			<listitem><para>
					The self-service app has been enhanced in two areas:
				</para>
				<itemizedlist>
					<listitem><simpara>
							End users can now use the self-service web interface not only for changing passwords, but also for editing their own contact information.
					</simpara></listitem>
					<listitem><simpara>
							Administrators can now use the self-service to invite new users by mail.
							In this process, new users are send a self-service token that they can use to add their password and contact information to the prepared account in the UCS domain.
					</simpara></listitem>
				</itemizedlist>
			</listitem>
			<listitem><para>
					The portal has been extended to forward users directly to the login page and to display information texts if the portal is empty.
					The rendering has been optimized and is now customizable via CSS.
					Furthermore, the portal now has an improved permission management, which allows more access protection on the server side, which forms the basis for future enhancements.
			</para></listitem>
			<listitem><para>
					The RADIUS app has been unified by merging the implementations from &ucsUAS; and the UCS app.
					As part of the implementation, the exchange of <phrase>Shared Secrets</phrase>, e.g. with WiFi access points, has been simplified:
					The access point configuration can now be done using the UMC computer module.
			</para></listitem>
			<listitem><para>
					Samba has been updated to version <productnumber>4.10 RC2</productnumber>, which includes numerous improvements.
				</para>
				<para>
					With this version, trust settings between UCS and Microsoft Active Directory domains can be configured.
					This makes it possible, for example, for users administered in UCS to gain access to services operated in Microsoft domains.
				</para>
				<para>
					Furthermore Samba now supports <phrase>Fine Grained Password Policies</phrase>, with which it is possible to define different and detailed password policies within the Microsoft Active Directory or Kerberos domain.
			</para></listitem>
			<listitem><para>
					The user experience in the &ucsUMC; has been improved in many ways.
					These include a clearer display of input elements, better handling of long result lists and a more efficient display on small displays.
			</para></listitem>
			<listitem><para>
					The settings for a user's access to installed apps can now be managed on a central tab on the user object.
					This simplifies both the administration of UCS and the integration by App Providers.
			</para></listitem>
			<listitem><para>
					For App Providers <phrase>Install Permissions</phrase> are a new feature in the App Center:
					They allow to specify for each version whether the App requires a contractual relationship between user and provider for installation.
					The App Center thus better supports corresponding business models of the app providers and users can better recognize which versions of an app are available.
			</para></listitem>
			<listitem><para>
					UCS <productnumber>4.4-1</productnumber> is based on the Debian release <productnumber>9.8</productnumber> released in February.
					A complete list of security and package updates is available in <xref linkend="relnotes:changelog"/>.
			</para></listitem>

		<title>Notes about the update</title>
		<para>
			During the update some services in the domain may not be available temporarily, that is why the update should occur in a maintenance window.
			It is recommended to test the update in a separate test environment prior to the actual update.
			The test environment should be identical to the production environment.
			Depending on the system performance, network connection and the installed software the update will take between 20 minutes and several hours.
		</para>

		<section id="relnotes:order">
			<title>Recommended update order for environments with more than one UCS server</title>
			<para>
				In environments with more than one UCS system, the update order of the UCS systems must be borne in mind:
			</para>

			<para>
				The authoritative version of the LDAP directory service is maintained on the &ucsMaster; and replicated to all the remaining LDAP servers of the UCS domain.
				As changes to the LDAP schema can occur during release updates, the &ucsMaster; must always be the first system to be updated during a release update.
			</para>
		</section>

		<section id="relnotes:32bit">
			<title>UCS installation DVD only available for 64 bit</title>
			<para>
				Starting with UCS 4.0, installation DVD are only provided for the x86 64 bit architecture (amd64).
				Existing 32 bit UCS 3 systems can still be updated to UCS 4.0 through the online repository or by using update DVD.
				The 32 bit architecture will be supported over the entire UCS 4 maintenance period.
			</para>
		</section>

	<chapter id="relnotes:prepare">
		<title>Preparation of update</title>

		<para>
			It must be checked whether sufficient disk space is available.
			A standard installation requires a minimum of 10 GB of disk space.
			The update requires approximately 4 GB additional disk space to download and install the packages, depending on the size of the existing installation.
		</para>

		<para>
			For the update, a login should be performed on the system's local console as user <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem>, and the update should be initiated there.
			Alternatively, the update can be conducted using &ucsUMC;.
		</para>

		<para>
			Remote updating via SSH is not recommended as this may result in the update procedure being canceled, e.g., if the network connection is interrupted.
			In consequence, this can affect the system severely.
			If updating should occur over a network connection nevertheless, it must be verified that the update continues in case of disconnection from the network.
			This can be achieved, e.g., using the tools <command>screen</command> and <command>at</command>.  These tools are installed on all UCS system roles by default.
		</para>

		<para>
			Univention provides a script that checks for problems which would prevent the successful update of the system. Prior to the update, this script
			can be downloaded and executed on the UCS system.

			Following the update, new or updated join scripts need to be executed.
			This can be done in two ways:
			Either using the UMC module  <guimenu>Domain join</guimenu> or by running the command
			<command>univention-run-join-scripts</command> as user <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem>.

		<section id="relnotes:notifier">
			<title>&ucsUDN;</title>
			<para>
				Due to a design flaw in the &ucsUDN; network protocol version 2 any user can retrieve information about changes to the LDAP directory.
				A new protocol version 3 was implemented with <ulink url="http://errata.software-univention.de/ucs/4.3/427.html">UCS-4.3-3 erratum 427</ulink>.
				For backward compatibility with old UCS systems the &ucsUDN; still provided version 2 by default.
				For new installations starting with UCS-4.4 only version 3 is enabled by default.
				Protocol version 2 can be re-enabled by changing the &ucsUCRV; <envar>notifier/protocol/version</envar> to <literal>2</literal> and restarting the &ucsUDN;.
			</para>
		</section>

		<section id="relnotes:usage">
			<title>Collection of usage statistics</title>
			<para>
				Anonymous usage statistics on the use of &ucsUMC; are collected when using the <emphasis>UCS Core Edition</emphasis>.
				The modules opened get logged to an instance of the web traffic analysis tool Piwik.
				This makes it possible for Univention to tailor the development of &ucsUMC; better to customer needs and carry out usability improvements.
			</para>
			<para>
				This logging is only performed when the <emphasis>UCS Core Edition</emphasis> license is used.
				The license status can be verified via the menu entry <guimenu>License &ar; License information</guimenu> of the user menu in the upper right corner of &ucsUMC;.
				If <guimenu>UCS Core Edition</guimenu> is listed under <guimenu>License type</guimenu>, this version is in use.
				When a regular UCS license is used, no usage statistics are collected.
			</para>
			<para>
				Independent of the license used, the statistics generation can be deactivated by setting the &ucsUCRV; <envar>umc/web/piwik</envar> to <emphasis>false</emphasis>.
			</para>
		</section>

		<section id="relnotes:secbrowsers">
			<title>Scope of security support for WebKit, Konqueror and QtWebKit</title>
			<para>
				WebKit, Konqueror and QtWebKit are shipped in the maintained branch of the UCS repository, but not covered by security support.
				WebKit is primarily used for displaying HTML help pages etc.
				Firefox should be used as web browser.
			</para>
		</section>

		<section id="relnotes:browsers">
			<title>Recommended browsers for the access to &ucsUMC;</title>

			<para>
				&ucsUMC; uses numerous JavaScript and CSS functions to display the web interface.
				Cookies need to be permitted in the browser.
				The following browsers are recommended:
