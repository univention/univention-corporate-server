        <para>
            Univention App Center is an ecosystem similar to the app stores
            known from mobile platforms like Apple or Google. It provides an
            infrastructure to build, deploy and run enterprise applications on
            Univention Corporate Server (UCS). The App Center uses well-known
            technologies like <ulink url="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</ulink>.

    <title>Get Started</title>

    <para>
        This chapter describes the requirements and the steps to create an app
        for Univention App Center. After reading this chapter an app provider
        will be able to create their own app and start with a development and test cycle
        using the Test App Center.

            <title>Software in a Docker image</title>
            <para>
                The software needs to be provided as a <ulink
                    url="https://docs.docker.com/">Docker image</ulink>. This
                is the easiest way to deploy software in Univention App Center.
                It is also recommended to publish the Docker container to
                <ulink url="https://hub.docker.com/">Docker hub</ulink>. This
                makes referencing the image later much easier and simplifies
                the development and test cycle during development. If public
                access to the image is not wanted, it can be made private and
                granted access to the Docker Hub user
                <userinput>univention</userinput>. In this case, the image has
                to be copied manually by the App Center team to the Univention
                Docker registry.

            <para>
                The image must have a version tag to distinguish different

                Many Docker apps expose a web interface to the outside world,
                e.g. via the port 8080. The App Center on UCS takes care to map
                this web interface from some relative link to this port and adds a
                reverse proxy configuration to the host's webserver
                configuration.

    <para>
        This chapter relates the life cycle of an app from the first app
        development, its life in the public to termination. The life cycle
        applies to the app overall and to every single version.

            Every app starts with its development. It involves the definition
            of the app in the App Provider Portal, providing the software
            solution as a Docker image (see <xref linkend="get-started" />)
            and the integration of the solution with UCS, for example in the
            identity management area (see <xref linkend="connection-idm" />).
            This part of the life cycle can be divided into two steps: setup
            and integration.

            <title>Best practice for app development environment</title>
            <para>
                This section briefly describes best practices on the development and
                testing environment for apps dedicated to the Univention App
                Center. The recommendations aim at reducing repeatable time
                efforts that, for example, are caused by the download of Docker
                images.
            </para>
            <para>
                The development of apps mainly involves the App Provider portal
                and a local instance of Univention Corporate Server (UCS). To
                setup your UCS environment the best practice is to download one
                of the UCS virtual machine images and use VirtualBox or VMware
                (see <xref linkend="testing:download" />). After the
                installation, <ulink
                    url="https://docs.software-univention.de/manual.html#central:license">activate
                    the system</ulink> and copy your SSH key to the UCS system
                to save typing the password on each remote console login.
                Finally, activate the Test App Center (see <xref
                    linkend="testing:test-app-center" />). With that status it
                is a good time to make a snapshot of the system, which allows
                to got back to that status. Afterwards, app specific time
                consuming tasks can be prepared to reduce recurring waiting
                times. Among them are for example an optional <userinput>docker
                    login</userinput> to gain access to a private Docker image
                or even the own Docker registry, and the manual download of the
                app's Docker image(s) with <userinput>docker pull</userinput>
                (for single container apps) or <userinput>docker-compose -p
                    $appid pull</userinput> (for multi container apps) from the
                within the <filename>docker-compose.yml</filename> directory of
                the app (see <xref linkend="testing:debugging" />). And then
                also make a new snapshot. Especially, having the Docker
                image(s) locally saves download time during recurring
                installation test cycles.
            </para>
            <para>
                With the last snapshot there is a prepared system that can
                serve as starting point for app installation and associated
                testing. The development iteration cycles are a dance of
                changes in the App Provider portal and testing the installation
                and app integration. After returning to a snapshot, it is
                recommended to update the local App Center cache. This is
                either automatically done during login and opening of the App
                Center module in the UCS management system or triggered
                manually with <userinput>univention-app update</userinput> on
                the console.

                During app development or for problem analysis it is necessary
                to debug an app. If an app installation fails, the App Center
                removes the docker container and thus prevents the developer to
                have a deeper look into what happened. With the following
                command the App Center will not throw away a failed app
                installation. The container is kept on the system.
                <programlisting>

            Testing the app also involves giving an approval for the release

            automated tests. As soon as the automated tests are successful, the
            second approval is available and the app is ready to be released.
        </para>
        <para>
            The automated tests conducted by Univention test for installation,
            un-installation and re-installation of the app for different UCS
            system roles. They check for proper operation of the UCS services.
            No app functionality will be tested. The tests are for ensuring that the
            app does not break UCS functionality.
        </para>
        <para>
            Besides the technical testing, the first release also undergoes a
            manual review process on the app presentation. The app description
            is checked for plausibility, understandability and for the App
            Center context.

        <para>
            As soon as the app is ready for release, it is copied to the
            productive App Center by the Univention App Center team. This
            involves the app's presentation material as well as the Docker
            image. Univention maintains an own Docker registry. The Docker
            image is copied to that registry and the reference to the Docker
            image is updated accordingly in the app definition. The app will
            be visible in the App Center UMC module immediately for all UCS
            users. The app catalog is updated automatically and shows the new
            app.

        <para>
            After the release of the first version the app enters
            "maintenance mode" and receives updates from the app provider. The
            evolution of an app is represented by its version. In order to
            provide an update for the app, follow these steps:

                        Create a new version of the app: Mouse over the app's
                        tile, click the menu in the upper right corner of the
                        tile and select <guimenu>New App Version</guimenu>.

                        configuration to the target.

                        Usual places for changes involve the scripts and maybe
                        the integration. Texts and logos should be checked if
                        they are still up to date.

            If the app provider decides to discontinue an app and stop
            maintenance, the app can be terminated by setting it <userinput>end
                of life</userinput>.  As soon as an app is published in status
            end of life, UCS system administrators won't be able to install it
            anymore. UCS systems that already have the app installed, will show
            a notification in the App Center that informs the UCS system
            administrator that they should look for alternative solutions.

        <para>
            App versions are not explicitly terminated. They are superseded by

        <para>
            The app can be terminated by going to the app's configuration in

            Afterwards press <guimenu>Sync to Test App Center</guimenu> and
            <guimenu>Publish App</guimenu>. Please provide a custom message in
            the publish dialog and let the App Center team know about the
            reasons for the termination.

        <title>App Provider Portal upload interface</title>
        <para>
            An app is configured via the App Provider Portal, which offers a
            web interface. There is also an upload interface available. If the
            developer prefers to keep the app configuration in a version control
            system, the upload interface offers a good way to push changes for
            the app to the Test App Center. The script can also be used in
            non-interactive mode within other scripts. In such cases username
            and password should be stored in separate files (no new line at the
            end) that are passed as parameters.

    <para>
        This chapter is about how the app is presented to the user with texts,
        logos, screenshots and videos. The contents are part of the app
        configuration. They are shown to the UCS system administrator in the
        App Center UMC module in UCS and to users on the Univention website in
        the <ulink

    <section id="logos">
        <title>Logos</title>
        <para>
            All logos uploaded to the App Provider Portal have to be SVG
            format, which is most flexible for the presentation purposes.
        </para>

        <important>
            <para>
                When SVG files are created or exported, please make sure that
                fonts are converted to paths before export. Otherwise the text
                in the logos is not rendered properly and the logo may look
                odd.
            </para>
            <para>
                Please also do not simply import a bitmap graphic into SVG and
                export it. Results after scaling may not look good, because the
                logo is basically a bitmap in SVG apparel.
            </para>
        </important>

        <para>
            The logos can be uploaded on the <guimenu>General</guimenu> tab in
            the <guimenu>Logos</guimenu> section. Two icons are needed: One for
            the app tile on the overview page and a more detailed logo for the
            app page. The tile has only limited space in square format. Please
            make sure, the logo can still be recognized. The detailed logo is
            not limited. Most logos for this slot have a landscape orientation.
            The App Center and the App Catalog take care of the appropriate
            scaling. SVG allows a very good result due to its nature as a vector
            graphics format.

            Screenshots and videos are a good way to introduce the solution to
            the user. To add screenshots please go to the <guimenu>Screenshots
                and videos</guimenu> tab for upload. Screenshots can be in PNG
            or JPG format. Videos have to be published on YouTube and the full
            YouTube link has to be provided in the App Provider Portal. Please
            keep in mind that the screenshots and videos in this tab must be
            for an English speaking audience.
        </para>
        <para>
             If the same screenshots exist in German, it is recommended that
             they are added, as well, in the <guimenu>Translations</guimenu> tab

        <para>
            Comprehensive visualizations can be added optionally which make it
            easier to understand the app's description. Give the image files
            sensible names including the keywords. An example of a bad file
            name for an image would be “app_76bz3.jpg”, whereas
            “<wordasword>app_name.jpg</wordasword>” would be much better.

            <para>
                Custom styles in CSS should not be used, because they may

        </note>
        <para>
            The length of the description depends on how much there is to say
            and how much explanation the app requires. Ideally the description
            should be at least 300 words long.  The text should be structured
            and paragraphs should be used to make it easier to read. The target group are
            potential customers. Subheadings (HTML: <wordasword>h2,
                h3</wordasword>) should be used to divide the text into logical
            sections. It is very helpful for the reader to be able to see the
            advantages of the app and its combination with UCS at a glance. For
            this reason, presentation of the advantages in lists (HTML:
            <wordasword>ol, ul, li</wordasword>) is particularly practical.
        </para>
        <para>
            If links are used in the app description (e.g., to pages on
            the solution's own website), please always use the
            <userinput>target="_blank"</userinput> (open in new tab) and assign
            the link a title attribute. Please keep the use of links to a
            minimum and ideally use the fields provided especially for this
            purpose in the app metadata.

            On the <guimenu>License</guimenu> tab license information can be defined; for
            example, a license agreement. This should be read by a
            UCS system administrator and has to be accepted before the
            app is installed. If the text is not accepted, the installation
            process is aborted and no app is installed. The license agreement
            is mostly used by app providers for legal information that needs
            confirmation by the administrator before anything is installed. If
            such a text is not needed, leave it empty.
        </para>
        <para>
            UCS system administrators have to register with a valid email
            address in order to use the App Center. If the app provider
            configures an email address in the field <option>E-mail address for
                App install notifications</option> it receives information on a
            daily basis about who installed the app. The App Center UMC
            module informs the user that the app provider may contact them. App
            providers can use the address, for example, for lead management.

    <title>Connection with Identity Management</title>

    <para>
        One of the <wordasword>UCS's</wordasword> key features is the
        integrated identity management (IDM). With this central identity
        management, users benefit, among other things, from a single login
        independent of which services or systems they use. It is highly
        recommended to integrate the app into the identity management system.
    </para>

    <para>
        If the app should benefit from the identity management, the flag
        <guimenu>Add activation checkbox for App in UCS user
            management</guimenu> should be activated in the App Provider Portal
        on the <guimenu>Advanced</guimenu>. This extends the IDM by a checkbox
        and an administrator of the UCS system can activate or deactivate each
        user individually for the app. The setting can then be found in the
        Users UMC module and is called <guimenu>Apps</guimenu>. It is also
        possible to make significantly more complex settings. See <xref

                principle a join script is a script that runs after the
                installation of an app and it has write access to the LDAP
                directory service. If it runs successfully, the join script may
                save this information in a status file. If this does not
                happen, the user is constantly reminded to re-run the join
                script. So the join script does not need to run successfully.
                The installation will not be aborted at this point. But of
                course at some point it should run through successfully.

    <title>App Appliances</title>

    <para>
        App Appliances are pre-defined images which consist of the App, the UCS
        management system and the UCS runtime environment. They are run as a
        virtual machine within a hypervisor and are currently provided as
        VMware, VMware ESXi, VirtualBox and KVM images. By default the UCS
        branding is used, but it is possible and recommended to use a custom
        branding.
    </para>

    <section id="app-appliances:create">
        <title>Create an app appliance</title>
        <para>
            To create an appliance, select an app version that has already been
            published and activate the <guimenu>Create App appliance</guimenu>
            checkbox on the <guimenu>Appliance</guimenu> tab. If the solution
            needs a minimum size of memory, please specify the needed mega
            bytes.
        </para>

        <section id="appliance:additional-software">
            <title>Additional software</title>
            <para>
                If the appliance should include additional apps, please specify
                them in the <guimenu>Additional software</guimenu> section.

        <section id="appliance:customize-setup-wizard">
            <title>Customize setup wizard in appliance</title>
            <para>
                The appliance allows customization of the UCS setup wizard and
                controls which setup pages and setup fields should be hidden. For
                simplicity towards the user, it is recommended to hide the
                <userinput>software</userinput> page and the
                <userinput>basesystem</userinput> setup field.
            </para>

        <section id="appliance:customize-app-center">
            <title>Customize app listing in App Center</title>
            <para>
                The listing of apps in the App Center UMC module in the
                appliance can be customized to either whitelist or blacklist
                certain apps. For example, if the solution is a groupware,
                other groupware solutions can be hidden from the overview
                listing. System administrators can only install the whitelisted
                apps or are not allowed to install the black listed apps.
            </para>

            <title>First steps information</title>
            <para>
                The appliances are usually configured in such a way that the user
                can start using them right away. In some cases it may be
                necessary to provide some information for the first steps. For
                example, the user needs to know that a user object has to be
                created and activated for the app first. This could be briefly
                described in this section. The German translation should be
                kept in mind and provided.

            <para>
                The appliance also allows to customize the UMC modules which
                should be pre-configured for the favorites section in the UCS
                management system. The favorites section comes up first, after
                a UCS system administrator logs onto the UCS management system.
                It is recommended to have the modules
                <userinput>Users</userinput>, <userinput>Groups</userinput> and
                <userinput>App Center</userinput> listed here.

                    Center</guimenu>, click the <guimenu>Publish App</guimenu>
                button and provide a custom message to let the Univention team
                know that an appliance is ready to be build. This will create
                a ticket which helps to keep the communication in one place.

                The appliance is automatically built in the Univention build
                infrastructure. After the build is finished, automatic tests will
                be started. Build and testing will approximately need four hours.
            </para>
            <para>
                After the automatic tests have finished successfully, the app
                provider is informed. A link to the appliance download is sent
                and a few days are given for testing. If no veto is
                sent, the Appliance is usually published after the veto
                deadline. After the release, the appliance will show up for
                download on the app page in the App Catalog. App Providers are
                recommended to also place a link to the app detail page from
                their download page. The link is one criteria for the
                recommended apps badge in the App Center overview and the App
                Catalog.
