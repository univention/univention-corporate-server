[logging]
# Specifies that entity should use the specified
# destination for logging.
#
# Format format destinations:
#
#   STDERR
#      This logs to the program's stderr.
#
#   FILE:/file
#   FILE=/file
#      Log to the specified file. The form using a colon appends to the file,
#      the form with an equal truncates the file. The truncating form keeps the
#      file open, while the appending form closes it after each log message
#      (which makes it possible to rotate logs). The truncating form is mainly
#      for compatibility with the MIT libkrb5.
#
#   DEVICE=/device
#      This logs to the specified device, at present this is the same as
#      FILE:/device.
#
#   CONSOLE
#      Log to the console, this is the same as DEVICE=/dev/console.

#   SYSLOG[:priority[:facility]]
#      Send messages to the syslog system, using priority, and facility. To get
#      the name for one of these, you take the name of the macro passed to
#      syslog(3), and remove the leading LOG_ (LOG_NOTICE becomes NOTICE).  The
#      default values (as well as the values used for unrecognised values), are ERR,
#      and AUTH, respectively.  See syslog(3) for a list of priorities and
#      facilities.
#
# Each destination may optionally be prepended with a range of logging levels,
# specified as min-max/. Either of the min and max valued may be omitted, in
# this case min is assumed to be zero, and max is assumed to be infinity.  If
# you don't include a dash, both min and max gets set to the specified value.
# If no range is specified, all messages gets logged.
