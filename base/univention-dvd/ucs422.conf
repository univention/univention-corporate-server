# Set these to point to scripts/programs to be called at various
# points in the debian-cd image-making process. This is the ideal place
# to customise what's on the CDs, for example to add extra files or
# modify existing ones. Each will be called with the arguments in order:
#
# $TDIR (the temporary dir containing the build tree)
# $MIRROR (the location of the mirror)
# $DISKNUM (the image number in the set)
# $CDDIR (the root of the temp disc tree)
# $ARCHES (the set of architectures chosen)
#
# BE CAREFUL about what you do at each point: in the first couple of
# cases, files and directories you're looking to use may not exist yet,
# you may need to worry about adding entries into md5sum.txt yourself
# and (in the last couple of cases) if you add any extra files you may
# end up over-filling the disc. If you *do* need to add files at the end
# of the process, see RESERVED_BLOCKS_HOOK below. It's strongly
# recommended to do this kind of customisation up-front if you can, it's
# much simpler that way!
