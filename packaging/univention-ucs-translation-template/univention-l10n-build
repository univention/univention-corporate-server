"""This script reads debian/*.univention-l10n files inside the current working
directory and creates gettext Portable Objects defined within. It intends to
facilitate and homogenize the translation build process.

Add it to the build target inside debian/rules to build the POs for a certain
language or use it manually inside source packages to update the translation
catalog.

Example debian/rules override:

override_dh_auto_build:
	univention-l10n-build fr
	dh_auto_build
