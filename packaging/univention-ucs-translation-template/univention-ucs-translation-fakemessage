Usage: univention-ucs-translation-fakemessage [directory]

This script walks over all po files in a given directory and its subfolders.
It fills all msgid strings with the same content as the corresponding msgid,
prepeding it with the character sequence '!TR!'.
It is useful for visual quick testing of translation coverage and po file
generation.
