# This Makefile is copied to translation source packages generated by
# univention-ucs-translation-build-package. It defines the receipts to build
# binary translation targets(mo files). The include 'all_targets.mk' is
# generated by the same script and contains all actual targets.

build:

include all_targets.mk
install: $(ALL_TARGETS)

%.mo:
	install -d $(@D)
	msgfmt --check --output-file="$@" "$<"

%.json:
	dh-umc-po2json "$<"  # creates .json file in the same directory as the .po file
	install -d $(@D)
	mv "$(patsubst %.po,%.json,$<)" "$@"
