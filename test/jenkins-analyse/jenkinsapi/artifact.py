"""
Artifacts can be used to represent data created as a side-effect of running
a Jenkins build.

Artifacts are files which are associated with a single build. A build can
have any number of artifacts associated with it.

This module provides a class called Artifact which allows you to download
objects from the server and also access them as a stream.
