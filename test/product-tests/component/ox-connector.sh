   # Define another Proxy Container with different timeout for the sync clients. Microsoft recommends a minimum value of 15 minutes.
   # Setting the value lower than the one defined as com.openexchange.usm.eas.ping.max_heartbeat in eas.properties will lead to connection
   # timeouts for clients.  See https://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=905013 for additional information.

   # When using a single node system or using BalancerMembers that are assigned to other balancers please add a second hostname for that
   # BalancerMember's IP so Apache can treat it as additional BalancerMember with a different timeout.

  # When specifying additional mappings via the ProxyPass directive be aware that the first matching rule wins. Overlapping urls of
  # mappings have to be ordered from longest URL to shortest URL.
  #
  # Example:
  #   ProxyPass /ajax      balancer://oxcluster_with_100s_timeout/ajax
  #   ProxyPass /ajax/test balancer://oxcluster_with_200s_timeout/ajax/test
  #
  # Requests to /ajax/test would have a timeout of 100s instead of 200s
